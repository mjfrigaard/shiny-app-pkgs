  Follow the tidyverse style guide:
  * Limit code to 80 characters per line   
  * File names should be machine readable (no spaces, symbols, or special 
    characters)   
  * Variables and function names should all be `snake_case` (i.e., lowercase
    letters, numbers, and underscores to separate words within a name).   
  * Place a space before and after `=`   
  * Avoid empty lines at the start or end of functions   
  * Only use a single empty line when needed to separate functions or pipes   
  * Use verbs for function names   
  * If a function name and definition canâ€™t fit on a single line, indent the
    argument name with a single indent (i.e. two spaces).   
  * Comments should be in sentence case   
  * Spread long function calls across multiple lines    
  * Always use double quotes for strings   
  * Use double quotes, not single quotes, for quoting text   
  * Use base pipe `|>` (not `%>%`)
