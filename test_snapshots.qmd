# Snapshot tests {#sec-tests-snapshots-vdiffr}

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| echo: false 
#| include: false
source("_common.R")
library(rlang)
```

```{r}
#| label: co_box_dev
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "o", look = "minimal",
  header = "Caution",
  contents = "This chapter is under review.",
  fold = FALSE
)
```

If we want to create a graph snapshot test, the [`vdiffr`](https://vdiffr.r-lib.org/) package allows us to perform a 'visual unit test' by capturing the expected output as an `.svg` file that we can compare with future versions.

```{r}
#| label: git_box_23_tests-snapshots
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_margin_box(
  contents = "launch",
  fig_pw = '65%', 
  branch = "23_tests-snapshots", 
  repo = 'moviesApp')
```

## `vdiffr`

The `expect_doppelganger()` function from `vdiffr` is designed specifically to work with ['graphical plots'](https://vdiffr.r-lib.org/reference/expect_doppelganger.html).

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
vdiffr::expect_doppelganger(
      title = "name of graph", 
      fig = # ...code to create graph...
  )
```

Another option for using snapshots for testing is the `expect_snapshot_file()` function [^test_tools-12] but `expect_doppelganger()` is probably the better option for comparing graph outputs.

[^test_tools-12]: Follow the `expect_snapshot_file()` example from the [`testthat` documentation](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/expect_snapshot_file.html#ref-examples)

## Testing graph outputs

The `Feature` for the initial graph output from `scatter_plot()` might look like: 

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
testthat::describe(
  "Feature: Scatter Plot Configuration in Movie Review Application
    As a user who accesses the movie review application,
    I want the initial scatter plot pre-configured with variables and aesthetics,
    So that I can immediately see a meaningful visualization.", code = {
    
})
```


Combining scenarios in the same test file is helpful if we're trying to keep a 1:1 between the `test/testthat/` file names and file names in `R/`.[^test_tools-13]

[^test_tools-13]: matching files names between `R/` and `tests/testthat/` keeps our code organized and ensures the `devtools::test_coverage_active_file()` function [works.](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/special-files.html)

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
testthat::it( # <1>
  "Scenario: Create scatter plot
      Given I have launched the movie review exploration app,
      When the scatter plot renders,
      Then the points on the x axis should represent 'Ratings'
      And the points on the y axis should represent 'Length'
      And the points should be colored by 'MPAA' rating
      And the opacity of the points should be set to '0.5'
      And the size of the points should be set to '2'

  code = {
    
    test_logger( # <2>
      start = "snap scatter_plot()", 
      msg = "initial x,y,z,size,alpha")  # <2>

    scatter_inputs <- list(  # <3>
      x = "imdb_rating",
      y = "audience_score",
      z = "mpaa_rating",
      alpha = 0.5,
      size = 2,
      plot_title = "Enter plot title"
    ) # <3>

    vdiffr::expect_doppelganger( # <4>
      title = "Initial x y z axes",
      fig = scatter_plot(movies,
        x_var = scatter_inputs$x,

        col_var = scatter_inputs$z,
        alpha_var = scatter_inputs$alpha,
        size_var = scatter_inputs$size
      ) +
        ggplot2::labs(
          title = scatter_inputs$plot_title,
          x = stringr::str_replace_all(

1.  Test scope  
2.  Log start  
3.  Initial `movies` variable inputs for `x`, `y`, and `z` from UI\
4.  Snapshot with initial values\
5.  Log end  

Test results also return the output from `test_logger()` with the context I've added on what's being tested.

### Snapshots

We also see a warning when the snapshot has been saved in the `tests/testthat/_snaps/` folder the first time the test is run:

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
── Warning (test-scatter_plot.R:124:9): 
      Scenario: Create scatter plot
          Given I have launched the movie review exploration app,
          When the scatter plot renders,
          Then the points on the x axis should represent 'Ratings'
          And the points on the y axis should represent 'Length'
          And the points should be colored by 'MPAA' rating
          And the size of the points should be set to '2'
          And the opacity of the points should be set to '0.5' ──

        And I select the variable 'IMDB Rating' for the y-axis
        And I select the variable 'Critics Rating' for the color
        Then the scatter plot should show 'Audience Score' on the x-axis
        And the scatter plot should show 'IMDB Rating' on the y-axis

[ FAIL 0 | WARN 2 | SKIP 0 | PASS 2 ]
```

On subsequent runs, this warning will disappear (as long as there are no changes to the `.svg` files). 

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false

```

```{r}
#| label: co_box_expect_doppelganger
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "g", fold = TRUE, 
  size = "1.05",
  header = "Reviewing snapshots",
  contents = "
Placing the functional requirement in the `title` argument of `expect_doppelganger()` gives us a clear idea of what the snapshot file *should* contain.
"
)
```

### Comparing graph objects

Below is the output from `diffobj::diffObj()` comparing our custom plotting function (`scatter_plot()`) against a graph built with analogous `ggplot2` code:

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
ggp_graph <- ggplot2::ggplot(mtcars, 
              ggplot2::aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) + 
              ggplot2::geom_point(
                ggplot2::aes(color = cyl), 
                             alpha = 0.5, 
                             size = 3)
  
app_graph <- scatter_plot(mtcars, 
                  x_var = "mpg", 
                  y_var = "disp", 
                  col_var = "cyl", 
                  alpha_var = 0.5, 
                  size_var = 3)

diffobj::diffObj(ggp_graph, app_graph)
```

Graph objects are difficult to use as test objects

The output shows us all the potential points of failure when comparing complex objects like graphs (despite the actual outputs appearing identical), so it's best to limit the number of 'visual unit tests' unless they're absolutely necessary.

## Recap 

I've included additional snapshot tests (`test-text_logo.R`) in the `23_tests-snapshots` branch of [`moviesApp`](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/moviesApp/tree/23_tests-snapshots): 

```bash
tests/testthat/
    ├── test-scatter_plot.R
    └── test-text_logo.R
```

```{r}
#| label: co_box_recap_userData
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "b", size = '1.05', hsize = '1.10',
  look = "default",
  header = "Recap: graph snapshots",
  contents = "
[**`vdiffr`**]{style='font-size: 1.30em'}
