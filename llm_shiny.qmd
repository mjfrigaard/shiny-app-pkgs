Since I began writing this book (in late 2022), the number of large-language models (LLMs) has grown significantly. The chapters in this section give an introduction to a few of the popular LLM tools available for building Shiny apps and R packages. Given the rapidly evolving landscape and nature of these tools, I expect these chapters to change frequently. Please open a GitHub issue is there is anything outdated, incorrect, or missing.
