Since I began writing this book (in late 2022), the number of large-language models (LLMs) has grown significantly. The chapters in this section introduce a few of the popular LLM tools available for building Shiny apps and R packages. Given these tools' rapidly evolving landscape and nature, I expect these chapters to change frequently. Please open a GitHub issue if there is anything outdated, incorrect, or missing.
