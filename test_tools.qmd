This chapter introduces some tools to help write clean and efficient tests. We'll cover using the [`ensure` package](https://simonpcouch.github.io/ensure/) to help write tests, where to store test data, snapshots, and more. Most of topics and methods covered in [R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#sec-testing-design-principles) and the `testthat` [documentation](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/third-edition.html), but within the context of a standard R package .[^test_tools-documentation] 

[^test_tools-documentation]: The three chapters in R Packages, 2ed, dedicated to testing are [Testing basics](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html), [Designing your test suite](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html), and [Advanced testing techniques](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-advanced.html)

```

## Unit tests & LLMs {#sec-test-tools-help}

I recommend using the [`ensure` package](https://simonpcouch.github.io/ensure/) to help write tests in your app-package. If you're already using LLMs to help write code, `ensure` is a nice addition to your toolbox because of it's focus on testing (we'll cover these tools more in the [Shiny Tools](tools.qmd) section).

```{r}
#| label: git_box_16.1_test-help
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_margin_box(
  contents = "launch",
  fig_pw = '65%', 
  branch = "16.1_test-help", 
  repo = 'sap')
```

> "*The ensurer is familiar with `testthat` 3e as well as tidy style, and incorporates context from the rest of your R package to write concise and relevant tests.*" - [`ensure` documentation](https://simonpcouch.github.io/ensure/) 

Follow the [setup instructions](https://simonpcouch.github.io/ensure/articles/ensure.html) to activate the addin (and I highly recommend creating a keyboard shortcut). 

### Help, not automation

The `ensure` package does a great job when writing basic unit tests, but as you'll see, it doesn't have a solid understanding of the specification or functional requirements of your application (only you know these). The test code created by `ensure` often needs some editing. 

For example, the following test code was created for `R/scatter_plot.R` function: 

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
test_that("scatter_plot creates a ggplot object", {
  
  p <- scatter_plot(mtcars, "mpg", "hp", "cyl", 0.7, 3)
  
  expect_s3_class(p, "gg")
  expect_equal(ggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$x.range,
    range(mtcars$mpg))
  expect_equal(ggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$y.range,
    range(mtcars$hp))
})

test_that("scatter_plot handles different alpha and size values", {
  
  p1 <- scatter_plot(mtcars, "mpg", "hp", "cyl", 0.5, 2)
  p2 <- scatter_plot(mtcars, "mpg", "hp", "cyl", 1, 4)
  
  expect_true(p1$layers[[1]]$aes_params$alpha < p2$layers[[1]]$aes_params$alpha)
  expect_true(p1$layers[[1]]$aes_params$size < p2$layers[[1]]$aes_params$size)
})
```

Based on the descriptions, these would test two important functional requirements of our application. However, two of these tests fail: 

```{verbatim}
[ FAIL 2 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 3 ]

── Failure (test-scatter_plot.R:6:3): scatter_plot creates a ggplot object ─────
ggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$x.range (`actual`) not equal to range(mtcars$mpg) (`expected`).

`actual` is NULL
`expected` is a double vector (10.4, 33.9)

── Failure (test-scatter_plot.R:8:3): scatter_plot creates a ggplot object ─────
ggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$y.range (`actual`) not equal to range(mtcars$hp) (`expected`).

`actual` is NULL
`expected` is a double vector (52, 335)
[ FAIL 2 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 3 ]
```

This might lead us to believe our utility function is not behaving as expected. But when we dig into the method and values these tests are using, we discover it's an issue with the test: 

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
# build plot
p <- scatter_plot(mtcars, "mpg", "hp", "cyl", 0.7, 3)
# check x 
ggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$x.range
```

```{verbatim}
NULL
```

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
# check y 
ggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$y.range
```

```{verbatim}
NULL
```

The correct code for these tests *would be* the `panel_params` (not `panel_ranges`), but these aren't going to work either, because `ggplot2` automatically adjusts the axis limits based on the data and potential aesthetic mappings (which we can confirm with `waldo::compare()`):[^ggp2-scales]

[^ggp2-scales]: Read more about numeric position scales in the [Position scales and axes](https://ggplot2-book.org/scales-position) chapter of [ggplot2, 3e](https://ggplot2-book.org/)

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
waldo::compare(
  x = ggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_params[[1]]$x.range, 
  y = range(mtcars$mpg))
```

```{verbatim}
`old`:  9.2 35.1
`new`: 10.4 33.9
```


```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
waldo::compare(
  x = ggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_params[[1]]$y.range, 
  y = range(mtcars$hp))
```

```{verbatim}
`old`: 37.9 349.1
`new`: 52.0 335.0
```

We can continue trying to find something produced by  [`ggplot2::ggplot_build()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot_build.html), but this test confirms the "*scatter_plot creates a ggplot object*", so why not just use [`ggplot2::is_ggplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/is_ggplot.html):

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
test_that("scatter_plot creates a ggplot object", {
  p <- scatter_plot(mtcars, "mpg", "hp", "cyl", 0.7, 3)
  expect_true(ggplot2::is_ggplot(p))
})
test_that("scatter_plot handles different alpha and size values", {
  p1 <- scatter_plot(mtcars, "mpg", "hp", "cyl", 0.5, 2)
  p2 <- scatter_plot(mtcars, "mpg", "hp", "cyl", 1, 4)
  expect_true(p1$layers[[1]]$aes_params$alpha < p2$layers[[1]]$aes_params$alpha)
  expect_true(p1$layers[[1]]$aes_params$size < p2$layers[[1]]$aes_params$size)
})
```

```{verbatim}
[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 3 ]
```

I've provided this example because it illustrates some important limitations when using `ensure` (or any LLMs) to help write code: **Don't confuse volume with precision.** LLMs are great at generating copius amounts of code, but have no way of checking if the code is functional or accurate. In this case, it arguably would've taken less time to do the research and write the correct test (instead of debugging the one created by `ensure`). 

It's also worth pointing out that if the original test code *did* pass, the `test_that()` description wouldn't the expectation (these belong in a "*scatter_plot x and y limits match true range of values*" test).

### Test scope {#sec-test-tools-scope}

One of the recent updates to the `testthat` package (version 3.2.0) emphasizes limiting code that exists outside of our tests.[^test_tools-testthat-recent-changes]

[^test_tools-testthat-recent-changes]: Read a summary of the changes to the `testthat` package on the [tidyverse blog](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/10/testthat-3-2-0/)

> "*Eliminating (or at least minimizing) top-level code outside of `test_that()` will have the beneficial effect of making your tests more hermetic. This is basically the testing analogue of the general programming advice that it's wise to avoid unstructured sharing of state.*" - [Self-sufficient tests, R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#self-sufficient-tests)

Strategies for reducing or removing the code outside of `test_that()` tests include:[^test_tools-pkg-dev-masterclass]

> 1. *Move file-scope logic to either narrower scope (just this test) or a broader scope (all files).*
> 
> 2. *It's ok to copy and paste: test code doesn't have to be super DRY. Obvious >>> DRY*

[^test_tools-pkg-dev-masterclass]: these tips (and more!) were covered in the Package Development Masterclass delivered at [posit::conf(2023)](https://github.com/posit-conf-2023)

Code outside of `test_that()` usually serves a specific purpose (load or manipulate data, set options, create folders or files, etc). The section below describes methods for including these behaviors in tests without placing code outside the test scope.

### Test fixtures {#sec-test-fixtures}

<!-- https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/self-cleaning-test-fixtures/ -->

Test fixtures can be anything used to create repeatable test conditions (data, file paths, functions, etc.). Good test fixtures provide a consistent, well-defined test environment, and then are removed/destroyed when the test is executed. This ensures any changes made during the test don't persist or interfere with future tests.[^test_tools-5]

[^test_tools-5]: For a concrete example, see [this article](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/self-cleaning-test-fixtures/) on self-cleaning tests.

In R packages, test fixtures are stored in the `tests/testthat/fixtures/` folder:[^tests-fixtures-folder-name]

[^tests-fixtures-folder-name]: The name '`fixtures`' isn't required (you can name this folder anything).

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
tests/
├── testthat/
│   └── fixtures/                                         
└── testthat.R
```

## Test data {#sec-test-data}

Large static data files are an example of a test fixture.[^test_tools-6] Any code used to create test data should be stored with the output file (using a clear naming convention).

[^test_tools-6]: Creating a tidied version of `ggplot2movies::movies` would be costly to re-create with every test, so it's advised to store it as an [static test fixture.](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-advanced.html#sec-testing-advanced-concrete-fixture)

```{r}
#| label: git_box_16.2_test-data
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_margin_box(
  contents = "launch",
  fig_pw = '65%', 
  branch = "16.2_test-data", 
  repo = 'sap')
```

For example, I've stored the code used to create a ['tidy' version](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/sap/blob/12a_tests-fixtures/tests/testthat/fixtures/make-tidy_ggp2_movies.R) of the `ggplot2movies::movies` data along with the output dataset in `tests/testthat/fixtures/`:

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
tests
├── testthat
│   ├── fixtures
│   │   ├── make-tidy_ggp2_movies # <1>
│   │   └── tidy_ggp2_movies.rds # <2>
│   └── test-scatter_plot.R
└── testthat.R

3 directories, 4 files
```

1.  The code used to create the test data (`make-make_tidy_ggp2_movies.R`)
2.  The test data file (i.e., `tidy_ggp2_movies.rds`):

Data files stored in `tests/testthat/fixtures/` can be accessed with `testthat::test_path()` inside each test.

Below is a test for the `scatter_plot()` utility function that answers the question, '*does the plot generate without producing an error?*' using the `tidy_ggp2_movies.rds` test fixture:

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
describe( # <1>
  "Feature: Scatter plot data visualization
     As a film data analyst
     I want to explore IMDB.com movie review data 
     So that I can examine relationships between movie reivew metrics
   Background:
     Given I have IMDB movie reviews data  
     And the data contains continuous variables like 'rating'
     And the data contains categorical variables like 'mpaa'", 
     code = { # <1>
    it( # <2>
      "Scenario: Scatter plot initial x, y, color values 
         When I launch the Scatter Plot Data Visualization
         And I have a IMDB dataset of movie reviews 
         Then the plot should show 'Rating' on the x-axis
         And the plot should show 'Length' on the y-axis
         And the points on the plot should be colored by 'MPAA' rating", 
        code = { # <2>
    ggp2_scatter_inputs <- list(  # <3>
          x = "rating",
          y = "length",
          z = "mpaa",
          alpha = 0.75,
          size = 3,
          plot_title = "Enter plot title"
        )              # <3>
    tidy_ggp2_movies <- readRDS(test_path("fixtures", # <4>
                                "tidy_ggp2_movies.rds")) # <4>
    app_graph <- scatter_plot(tidy_ggp2_movies,  # <5>
      x_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$x,
      y_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$y,
      col_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$z,
      alpha_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$alpha,
      size_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$size
    ) # <5>
    expect_true(ggplot2::is_ggplot(app_graph)) # <6> 
  }) 

}) # <1>
```
1.  Feature   
2.  Scenario   
3.  Test inputs   
4.  Test fixture  
5.  Create observed object  
6.  Expectation

This type of test is appropriate because we want to confirm the tidy movies data will generate a plot object when passed to our graphing utility function, not necessarily to verify the specific contents of the graph.[^test_tools-is_ggplot]

[^test_tools-is_ggplot]: Snapshot tests would be more appropriate for answering the question, ['*is the plot visually correct?*'](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/server-function-testing/index.html#complex-outputs-plots-htmlwidgets).

If the `tidy_ggp2_movies.rds` file in the `tests/testthat/fixtures/` folder are going to be used repeatedly, it might make sense to store the data in `inst/extdata/` or `data-raw/`. Test fixtures are described in-depth in [R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-advanced.html#test-fixtures) and in the [`testthat` documentation](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/test-fixtures.html#test-fixtures).

## Test logging {#sec-test-logger}


As we covered in the previous section (@sec-logging), we can  create a `test_logger()` helper function to monitor our tests and provide additional context:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| eval: true
#' Log test messages (helper)
#'
#' `test_logger()` logs informational messages using the `cli` package. It 
#' allows optional `start` and `end` tags to indicate the beginning and end of
#' a process.
#'
#' @param start A character string indicating the start tag. Default is `NULL`.
#' @param end A character string indicating the end tag. Default is `NULL`.
#' @param msg A character string containing the log message.
#'
#' @details
#' - If both `start` and `end` are `NULL`, logs only the message.
#' - If `start` is provided and `end` is `NULL`, logs a message prefixed with 
#' `START <start> = <msg>`.
#' - If `start` is `NULL` and `end` is provided, logs a message prefixed with 
#' `END <end> = <msg>`.
#' - If both `start` and `end` are provided, logs both `START` and `END`
#'  messages.
#'
#' @return Logs messages and returns `NULL` (used for side effects).
#'
#' @examples
#' test_logger(msg = "Processing started")
#' test_logger(start = "Step1", msg = "Loading data")
#' test_logger(end = "Step1", msg = "Data loaded successfully")
#' test_logger(start = "Step2", end = "Step2", msg = "Performing computation")
#'
#' @keywords internal
#' 
#' @export
test_logger <- function(start = NULL, end = NULL, msg) {
  if (is.null(start) & is.null(end)) {
    cat("\n")
    cli::cli_inform("TEST:[{format(Sys.time(), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] = {msg}")
  } else if (!is.null(start) & is.null(end)) {
    cat("\n")
    cli::cli_inform("\nTEST: START [{format(Sys.time(), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] {start} = {msg}")
  } else if (is.null(start) & !is.null(end)) {
    cat("\n")
    cli::cli_inform("\nTEST: END [{format(Sys.time(), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] {end} = {msg}")
  } else {
    cat("\n")
    cli::cli_inform("\nTEST: START [{format(Sys.time(), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}]{start} = {msg}")
    cat("\n")
    cli::cli_inform("\nTEST: END [{format(Sys.time(), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] {end} = {msg}")
  }
}
```

```{r}
#| label: git_box_16.3_test-logger
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_margin_box(
  contents = "launch",
  fig_pw = '65%', 
  branch = "16.3_test-logger", 
  repo = 'sap')
```

`test_logger()` can be used to log the `start` and `end` of each test, and it includes a message argument (`msg`) we can use to reference the test `description` in each `test_that()` or `it()` call.[^test_tools-logging]

[^test_tools-logging]: Check out the [`logger` package](https://daroczig.github.io/logger/) for more information on logging your app-package.

An example of using `test_logger()` with the `movies` data is below:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| eval: false
describe(
  "Feature: Scatter plot data visualization
     As a film data analyst
     I want to explore movie review data
     So that I can examine relationships between movie reivew metrics
   Background:
     Given I have movie reviews data
     And the data contains continuous variables like 'IMDB rating'
     And the data contains categorical variables like 'mpaa'",
     code = {
    test_that(
      "Scenario: Scatter plot initial x, y, color values 
         When I launch the Scatter Plot Data Visualization
         And I have a IMDB dataset of movie reviews 
         Then the plot should show 'IMDB rating' on the x-axis
         And the plot should show 'Audience score' on the y-axis
         And the points on the plot should be colored by 'MPAA' rating", 
        code = {
          
    ggp2_scatter_inputs <- list(y = 'audience_score', 
                                x = 'imdb_rating',
                                z = 'mpaa_rating',
                                alpha = 0.5,
                                size = 2,
                                plot_title = 'Enter plot title')
    
    test_logger(start = "Step1", msg = "loading movies data") #<1>
    movies <- sap::movies
    test_logger(end = "Step1", msg = "movies data loaded successfully")  #<1>
    
    test_logger(start = "Step2", msg = "creating graph")  #<2>
    app_graph <- scatter_plot(movies,
      x_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$x,
      y_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$y,
      col_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$z,
      alpha_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$alpha,
      size_var = ggp2_scatter_inputs$size
    )
    test_logger(end = "Step2", msg = "graph created")  #<2>
    
    expect_true(ggplot2::is_ggplot(app_graph))  #<3>
  }) 

})
```
1. Log the data loading  
2. Log the `scatter_plot()` function execution  
3. Run the test  

When the test is run, the following output is printed to the **Console**:

```{verbatim}
[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 0 ]
TEST: START [2025-02-06 07:50:53] Step1 = loading movies data

TEST: END [2025-02-06 07:50:53] Step1 = movies data loaded successfully

TEST: START [2025-02-06 07:50:53] Step2 = creating graph

TEST: END [2025-02-06 07:50:53] Step2 = graph created
[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 1 ]
```


There's nothing prohibiting placing `test_logger()` in a testing utility file ([`R/testthat.R`](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/sap/blob/13_tests-modules/R/testthat.R)) below the `R/` folder. Including testing functions in the `R/` folder also ensures they're documented (and any dependencies become part of your app-package).[^test_tools-helpers-r-dir]

[^test_tools-helpers-r-dir]: Placing common files for testing below `R/` is covered in [R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#hiding-in-plain-sight-files-below-r)

### Test helpers {#sec-test-helpers}

<!-- https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#testthat-helper-files -->

> "*Helper files are a mighty weapon in the battle to eliminate code floating around at the top-level of test files.*" Testthat helper files, [R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html#testthat-helper-files)


Test helpers reduce repeated/duplicated test code. In general, objects or values that aren't large enough to justify storing as static test fixtures can be created with helper functions. Helper functions are stored in `tests/testthat/helper.R`, which is automatically loaded with `devtools::load_all()`:

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
tests/
  ├── testthat/
  │   ├── fixtures/                                 # <1>
  │   │   ├── make-tidy_ggp2_movies.R               # <1>
  │   │   └── tidy_ggp2_movies.rds                  # <1>
  │   ├── helper.R                                  # <2>
  │   └── test-scatter_plot.R                       # <3>
  └── testthat.R
```
1.  Test fixture scripts and `.rds` files\
2.  Helper functions\
3.  Test file

Test helpers should only be created if they make testing easier **when the tests fail.** The article, ['Why Good Developers Write Bad Unit Tests'](https://mtlynch.io/good-developers-bad-tests/), provides great advice on complexity vs. clarity when writing unit tests,

> *'think about what will make the problem obvious when a test fails. Refactoring may reduce duplication, but it also increases complexity and potentially obscures information when things break.'*

R programmers resist copy + paste programming, and in most cases this makes sense. After all, R *is* a functional programming language, so it's tempting to bundle any repeated code into a function and store it in the `tests/testthat/helper.R` file.

However, when we're writing tests, it's more important that tests are easy to read and understand **when they fail**.

For example, consider the `ggp2_scatter_inputs` inputs passed to the `scatter_plot()` function in the previous test:

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
ggp2_scatter_inputs <- list(  
        x = "rating",
        y = "length",
        z = "mpaa",
        alpha = 0.75,
        size = 3,
        plot_title = "Enter plot title"
)            
```

We could write a `var_inputs()` function that stores these values in a list. In our tests, this would allow us to use `var_inputs()` with the same 'reactive syntax' we use with `scatter_plot()` in the module server function:

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| code-fold: false 
#| collapse: true
var_inputs <- function() {
   list(x = "rating",
        y = "length",
        z = "mpaa",
        alpha = 0.75,
        size = 3,
        plot_title = "Enter plot title")
}
var_inputs()
```

While this removes duplicated code, it also makes it less clear for the reader what `var_inputs()` contains and where it was created (without opening the `helper.R` file).

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
#| collapse: true

tidy_ggp2_movies <- readRDS(test_path("fixtures", # <1>
                                "tidy_ggp2_movies.rds")) # <1>
  
app_graph <- scatter_plot(
  tidy_ggp2_movies,
  x_var = var_inputs()$x, # <2>
  y_var = var_inputs()$y,
  col_var = var_inputs()$z,
  alpha_var = var_inputs()$alpha,
  size_var = var_inputs()$size) # <2>

testthat::expect_true(ggplot2::is_ggplot(app_graph))
```
1. Load test fixture  
2. Identical to the code in `mod_scatter_display_server()`

In contrast, the `make_ggp2_inputs()` function below creates inputs for the `scatter_plot()` utility function:

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| code-fold: false 
make_ggp2_inputs <- function() {
  glue::glue_collapse("list(x = 'rating',
     y = 'length',
     z = 'mpaa',
     alpha = 0.75,
     size = 3,
     plot_title = 'Enter plot title'
     )"
  )
}
```

I can call `make_ggp2_inputs()` in the **Console** and it will return the list of values to paste into each test:

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| code-fold: false 
#| collapse: true
make_ggp2_inputs()
```

While copying and pasting this list into the test doesn't reduce the number of keystrokes per test, it also doesn't obscure the source of the values in the test (like with `var_inputs()`).

`glue::glue_collapse()` is your friend when you want to quickly reproduce code for your tests. `make_var_inputs()` creates the list of inputs for testing the original `movies` data:

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| code-fold: false 
make_var_inputs <- function() {
  glue::glue_collapse("list(y = 'audience_score', 
     x = 'imdb_rating',
     z = 'mpaa_rating',
     alpha = 0.5,
     size = 2,
     plot_title = 'Enter plot title'
    )")
}
```

```{r}
#| label: co_box_dry
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "r", fold = FALSE,
  look = "default", hsize = "1.05", size = "0.95",
  header = "Violating the DRY principle",
  contents = "
If you have repeated code in your tests, consider the following questions below before creating a helper function: 
  
1. Does the code help explain what behavior is being tested? 
  
2. Would a helper make it harder to debug the test when it fails?  
  
It’s more important that test code is obvious than DRY, because it’s more likely you’ll be dealing with this test when it fails (and you're not likely to remember why all the top-level code is there).
  
"
)
```

### Test development {#sec-test-coverage-active-file}

While developing, using keyboard shortcuts makes it easier to iterate between building fixtures, writing and running tests, and checking code coverage.

```{r}
#| label: hot_key_cf_01
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
hot_key(fun = 'cf')
```

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
devtools:::test_coverage_active_file()
```

![Test coverage on active file](images/tests_coverage_scatter_plot.png){width="100%" fig-align="center"}

We can see the test coverage on the `scatter_plot()` function is 100%, but this only covers a small percentage of the code in our app-package.

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
devtools:::test_coverage()
```

## Test snapshots {#sec-test-snapshots}

```{r}
#| label: co_box_mocking
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "b", fold = TRUE, 
  look = "default", hsize = "1.05", size = "0.95",
  header = "Mocking",
  contents = "
Test mocks are covered in @sec-tests-mocks-snapshots, but the example isn't from our app-package (it comes from the package development masterclass given at [posit::conf(2023)](https://github.com/posit-conf-2023/pkg-dev-masterclass)). 
"
)
```

```{r}
#| label: git_box_16.4_test-snapshots
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

git_margin_box(

  fig_pw = '65%', 
  branch = "16.4_test-snapshots", 
  repo = 'sap')
```

If the expected output we're interesting in testing is cumbersome to describe programmatically, we can consider using a snapshot tests. 

Examples of this include UI elements (which are mostly HTML created by Shiny's UI layout and input/output functions) and data visualizations. Writing tests for these outputs can be difficult because their "correctness" is somewhat subjective and requires human judgment. [^test_tools-graph-snapshots]

[^test_tools-graph-snapshots]: Graph snapshots are covered in @sec-tests-snapshots-vdiffr.

I've included a small UI function (`text_logo()`) in the `R/` folder of `sap`: 

```{r}
#| eval: true 
#| code-fold: show 
#| code-summary: 'show/hide text_logo()'
#' Create a Text-based Logo in HTML
#'
#' `text_logo()` generates a text-based logo enclosed within HTML tags, allowing
#' for the specification of the heading size (h1 through h6). The logo features
#' a stylized representation of a face within arrows, using ASCII characters.
#'
#' @param size A character string specifying the heading size for the logo. 
#' Valid options include "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", and "h6". 
#' Defaults to "h3".
#'
#' @return An HTML object containing the logo. This object can be directly used
#' in R Markdown documents or Shiny applications to render the logo in a web page.
#'
#' @examples
#' # Generate a logo with default size h3
#' text_logo()
#'
#' # Generate a logo with size h1
#' text_logo(size = "h1")
#'
#'
#' @export
text_logo <- function(size = 'h3') {
  if (any(size %in% c("h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6"))) {
  htmltools::HTML(
    paste0(
    "<span>\n", 
      paste0("  <", size, ">", collapse = ""), "\n",
      "    <code>√\\/--‹(•_•)›--√\\/</code>\n", 
      paste0("  <", size, "/>", collapse = ""), "\n",
    "</span>\n"
      )
    )
  } else {
    rlang::abort(paste(size, "isnt supported", sep = " "))
  }
}
```

This function generates the HTML so we can include a small logo in the UI.[^test_tools-text_logo] 

[^test_tools-text_logo]: This is a simple example, but I chose it because it needs some tricky escape characters to work. 

:::{layout="[50,50]" layout-valign="center"}

The output in the UI:

``` r
text_logo()
```

The pre-rendered HTML:

``` html
<span>
  <h3>
    <code>√\/--‹(•_•)›--√\/</code>
  </h3>
</span>
```

:::

Reviewing the entire HTML contents of `movies_ui()` to see if `text_logo()` is working isn't practical, but we can store it's results in a snapshot file using `expect_snapshot()`. In `tests/testthat/test-text_logo.R`, I'll write the following tests:[^test_tools-snapshot-advice]

[^test_tools-snapshot-advice]: Mastering Shiny covers [creatng a snapshot file](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-testing.html#user-interface-functions) to test UI elements, but also notes this is probably not the best approach.

-   Confirm the default `size` argument:

    ```{r}
    #| code-fold: false
    #| eval: false
    describe(
        "Scenario: Generating a logo with default size
        Given the user did not specify a [size] in text_logo()
        When text_logo() is invoked without a [size] argument
        Then the correct HTML for a ['h3'] text logo is returned",
        code = {
      
        test_that("text_logo()", code = {
          test_logger(start = "snap", msg = "text_logo()")
          expect_snapshot(text_logo())
          test_logger(end = "snap", msg = "text_logo()")
        })
      })
    ```
    
-   Confirm a new `size` argument:

    ```{r}
    #| code-fold: false
    #| eval: false
      describe(
        "Scenario: Generating a logo of a specified size
        Given the user wants a ['h1'] sized text logo
        When text_logo(size = 'h1') is invoked

        code = {
          
        test_that("text_logo('h1')", code = {
          test_logger(start = "snap", msg = "text_logo('h1')")
          expect_snapshot(text_logo("h1"))
          test_logger(end = "snap", msg = "text_logo('h1')")
        })  
      })
    ```

-   Confirm an invalid `size` argument:

    ```{r}
    #| code-fold: false
    #| eval: false
    describe(
      "Scenario: Attempting to generate a logo with an invalid size
      Given the user specifies an invalid [size] for the text logo
      When text_logo() is invoked with an invalid [size] argument
      Then an error is returned stating the [size] is not recognized", 
      code = {
      test_that("text_logo('invalid')", code = {
        test_logger(start = "snap", msg = "text_logo('invalid')")
        expect_error(text_logo("massive"), NULL)
        test_logger(end = "snap", msg = "text_logo('invalid')")
        })
      })
    ```


    
When we test this file, we see the following warnings about the creating of the snapshot files:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

### Reviewing `_snaps/` {#sec-test-snaps-review}

Snapshots are stored in the `tests/testthat/_snaps/` folder. The output from `expect_snapshot_file()` is a markdown file with contents similar to what we saw above in the warning message. Should the markdown file contents change in future test runs, the tests will fail and we'll be prompted to review the changes. [^test_tools-shinytest2-snaps-prelude]

For example, if the `<span>` changed to a `<div>` in `text_logo()` and caused a test failure, I could review the changes in `tests/testthat/_snaps/text_logo.md` with `testthat::snapshot_review('text_logo')`:

:::{#fig-tests_tools_review_snapshot}

<h5>**Test tools**</h5>
  
In this chapter, we've covered powerful testing tools provided by the `testthat` and `ensure` packages. Let's briefly recep what we've learned:

  - **Test Help**: `ensure` provides LLMs help for getting a solid 'first draft' of your unit tests. I've found it's helpful to have an expectation (i.e., the `expected` argument of `expect_equal()`) before generating tests, as this makes it easier to review the test code (and make sure they're testing what matters).   
  
  - **Test Fixtures**: We've seen how test fixtures are reliable for setting up a consistent testing environment. Using fixtures to load test data ensures that each test runs under uniform conditions. This approach enhances our tests' reliability and simplifies the testing process by abstracting standard setup and teardown tasks.
  
    - Fixtures prepare the test environment and the initial state. The `tidy_ggp2_movies.rds` data is a test fixture, and it creates the `tidy_ggp2_movies` data within the test scope. 
  
  - **Test Helpers**: Helpers allow us to encapsulate repetitive tasks or setup configurations, making our tests cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain. Whether it's a custom function to create mock Shiny sessions or a utility for simulating user input, helpers streamline the testing workflow significantly.
  
    - If find yourself writing small, reusable pieces of code to perform specific tasks inside your tests, consider converting them into a function in `tests/testthat/helper.R`.

  - **Test Snapshots**: Snapshot testing introduces the `tests/testthat/_snaps` folder for capturing and comparing the Shiny application state over time. Snapshot testing helps ensure that changes to the application do not unintentionally alter its behavior or appearance, and snapshot files allow us to quickly identify and address regressions by automatically detecting differences between the expected and actual snapshots.
    
    - Test complex outputs using snapshots, but cautiously. Snapshots are susceptibile to failure with small (sometimes inconsequential) changes, which produce false negatives test failures.
