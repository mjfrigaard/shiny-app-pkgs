Developing an R package is similar to building a Shiny app--both involve writing code to perform specific outputs. We evaluate the outputs against our expectations and adjust as needed (either to the code or our expectations). While Shiny app development involves saving the code files and re-running the app, R package creation involves additional steps, which this chapter will cover.

If you'd like a refresher on the Shiny and R package chapters, I've provided a refresher of these topics below:

```{r}
#| label: co_box_desc_recap
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "b",
  look = "default", hsize = "1.10", size = "1.05",

  header = "Shiny Development & R Packages Refresher",
  contents = "
  
**Shiny apps:**
  
  -   **`R/` folder**: converting the application code into functions (i.e., modules and a standalone app function) and placing them alongside any utility functions in an `R/` folder removes the need to call `source()` in `app.R`.
  
  - **`www/` folder**: images, CSS, JavaScript, and other static resources can be stored in `www/` and Shiny will serve these files when the application is run.
  
**R Packages:**
  
-   R packages require a **`DESCRIPTION`** file with the following fields:
    -   `Package`, `Version`, `License`, `Description`, `Title`, `Author`, and `Maintainer`.

-   `usethis::create_package()` will create new app-packages, and can be used to convert existing Shiny app projects into Shiny app-packages.

-   The **Build** pane in the IDE requires the package build fields in the `.Rproj` file

    -   The package development settings can be accessed via **Tools** > **Project Options...** > **Build Tools**
  
  "
)
```

If you’re new to package development, having a little background on the `devtools` package is helpful. Earlier versions of `devtools` contained most of the functions used for package development. In version 2.0, `devtools` went under a [conscious uncoupling](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2018/10/devtools-2-0-0/#conscious-uncoupling), which means there was a "division of labor" for its core functionality:

-   The [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package contains the functions for *creating* package folders and files (`.R` files, tests, vignettes, etc.). `usethis` is also automatically loaded when you call `library(devtools)`.

-   Loading and building your app-package is handled by [`pkgload`](https://pkgload.r-lib.org/) and [`pkgbuild`](https://pkgbuild.r-lib.org/)

-   For app-packages destined for CRAN, the `R CMD check` is handled by [`rcmdcheck`](https://rcmdcheck.r-lib.org/) and [`revdepcheck`](https://github.com/r-lib/revdepcheck)

-   Installing packages from non-CRAN repositories (i.e., `install_github()`) is handled by [`remotes`](https://remotes.r-lib.org/)

You don't have to install all of these packages (they will be loaded with `devtools`), but the information is essential because it affects the dependencies in your app-package: 

> '*Package developers who wish to depend on `devtools` features should also pay attention to which package the functionality is coming from and depend on that rather than `devtools`. In most cases, packages should not depend on `devtools` directly.*' - [devtools 2.0.0, tidyverse blog](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2018/10/devtools-2-0-0/#conscious-uncoupling)

We will cover this topic more in the [dependencies chapter.](dependencies.qmd).

## Getting started

Before we can start developing, we need to install `devtools`:

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

`usethis` is automatically loaded/attached with `devtools`.

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
Loading required package: usethis
```


Let's assume we're continuing with a Shiny project from the [previous branch](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/sap/tree/03.1_description)  of `sap`. Our Shiny project has a `DESCRIPTION` file and the code has been placed in the `R/` folder, so we're ready to start developing our app-package with [`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) (the files and folders are below).

```{r}
#| label: git_box_03.1_description
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_margin_box(
  fig_pw = '70%', 
  branch = "03.1_description", 
  repo = 'sap')
```

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
sap/ 
  ├── DESCRIPTION # <1>
  ├── R
  │   ├── mod_scatter_display.R
  │   ├── mod_var_input.R
  │   └── utils.R
  ├── README.md
  ├── app.R
  ├── man
  ├── movies.RData
  ├── sap.Rproj # <2>
  └── www
      └── shiny.png

4 directories, 9 files
```
1. The [`DESCRIPTION` file](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/sap/tree/03.1_description/DESCRIPTION) contains the required fields: `Package`, `Version`, `License`, `Description`, `Title`, `Author`, and `Maintainer`.  
2. The [`.Rproj` file](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/sap/blob/03.1_description/sap.Rproj) is still configured to work with a Shiny project (not an R package).

### Keyboard shortcuts

I strongly recommend using the keyboard shortcuts for each `devtools` function. Shortcuts reduce typing and bundle all those keystrokes into a single action. They also create a kind of 'muscle memory' for each step.
  
In RStudio ![](images/rstudio-icon.png){height=20}, new keyboard shortcuts can be created using the [`shrtcts` package](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/shrtcts/) or by clicking on **Tools** > **Modify Keyboard Shortcuts**.

In Positron ![](images/positron.png){height=20}, the `devtools` functions covered below are already mapped to the keyboard shortcuts. Follow the instructions [found in Positron's Wiki](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/wiki/Keyboard-Shortcuts) to add new shortcuts.

### Habits

The differences between developing an R package and a Shiny app can be boiled down to a handful of [habits]{style="font-weight: bold; color: #5f2042;"}, each of which calls a `devtools` function: 

::: {.column-margin}

I'll use [this font style]{style="font-weight: bold; color: #5f2042;"} to indicate each habit and accompanying function.

:::

1. [Load]{style="font-weight: bold; color: #5f2042;"} all the functions and data in your app-package with `load_all()`

2. [Document]{style="font-weight: bold; color: #5f2042;"} the app-package functions and data with `document()`

3. [Install]{style="font-weight: bold; color: #5f2042;"} the app-package with `install()`

In the sections below, I'll cover each `devtools` function and my habits around their use when my Shiny app transitions to an app-package.[^dev-3]

[^dev-3]: The topics covered in this section shouldn't be considered a replacement for the ['Whole Game' chapter in R packages (2 ed)](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html) or the ['Workflow' section of Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-packaging.html#workflow) (and I highly recommend reading both).
 
## [Load]{style="font-weight: bold;"} {#sec-dev-load}

`load_all()` is the most common `devtools` function used during development. [Load the package when anything changes in the `R/` folder.]{style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.10em; color: #5f2042;"} 

> '*`load_all()` removes friction from the development workflow and eliminates the temptation to use workarounds that often lead to mistakes around namespace and dependency management*' - [Benefits of `load_all()`, R Packages, 2ed](https://r-pkgs.org/workflow101.html#benefits-of-load_all)


<br>

:::{layout="[45, 10, 45]" layout-valign="top"}

[<kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>]{style="font-size: 1.15em; font-weight: bold;"}

[=]{style="font-size: 1.50em; font-weight: bold;"}

[<code>devtools::load_all()</code>]{style="font-size: 1.15em; font-weight: bold;"}

:::

<br>

Using `load_all()` is similar to calling `library(sap)` because it loads the code in `R/` along with any data files. `load_all()` is also designed for iteration (unlike using `source()`), and when it's successful, the output is a single informative message:

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
ℹ Loading sap
```


## [Document]{style="font-weight: bold;"} {#sec-dev-document}

The `document()` function from `devtools` serves two purposes: 

1. Writing the package `NAMESPACE` file 

2. Creates the help files in the `man/` folder 

[Document a package whenever changes are made to the `roxygen2` syntax or `DESCRIPTION`.]{style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.10em; color: #5f2042;"} 

<br>

:::{layout="[45, 10, 45]" layout-valign="top"}

[<kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>]{style="font-size: 1.15em; font-weight: bold;"}

[=]{style="font-size: 1.50em; font-weight: bold;"}

[<code>devtools::document()</code>]{style="font-size: 1.15em; font-weight: bold;"}

:::

<br>

`devtools` is smart enough to recognize the first time `document()` is called, so when I initially run it in the **Console**, it prompts me that the `roxygen2` version needs to be set in the `DESCRIPTION` file:[^devtools-roxygen2]

[^devtools-roxygen2]: `devtools` relies on `roxygen2` for package documentation, so the `RoxygenNote` field is required in the `DESCRIPTION`. 

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
ℹ Updating sap documentation
First time using roxygen2. Upgrading automatically...
Setting `RoxygenNote` to "7.3.2"
```

You may have noticed calling `document()` also [calls `load_all()`](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/blob/2c642ab44f4fb9d4117f0e198dfcf42ad79e432a/R/document.R#L22), which scans the loaded package contents for special documentation syntax before writing the `NAMESPACE` file (we'll cover the `NAMESPACE` in the [Dependencies](dependencies.qmd) chapter). 

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
ℹ Loading sap
Writing NAMESPACE
```

If we open the `NAMESPACE` file, we see it's empty (and that we shouldn't edit this file by hand).


![Initial `NAMESPACE` file](images/dev_namespace.png){#fig-dev_namespace width='100%' fig-align='center'}




The last few output lines warn us to include the `Encoding` field in the `DESCRIPTION`. 

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
Warning message:
roxygen2 requires Encoding: "UTF-8"
ℹ Current encoding is NA 
```

`devtools` won't automatically add `Encoding` (like it did with `RoxygenNote` above), so we’ll need to add it to the `DESCRIPTION` file manually:

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
Package: sap
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Type: Package
Title: Shiny App-Packages
Description: An R package with a collection of Shiny applications.
Author: John Smith [aut, cre]
Maintainer: John Smith <John.Smith@email.io>
License: GPL-3
RoxygenNote: 7.2.3
Encoding: UTF-8  # <1>                                     
                                                      
```
1. The `Encoding` value shouldn't include quotes like the warning message above (i.e., `UTF-8`)   

After adding the required fields to the `DESCRIPTION` file,[^dev-4] we'll `document()` the package again and we should see the following:

[^dev-4]: Always leave an empty final line in the `DESCRIPTION` file.

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
==> devtools::document(roclets = c('rd', 'collate', 'namespace'))

ℹ Updating sap documentation
ℹ Loading sap
Documentation completed
```



## [Install]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  {#sec-dev-install}

The final development habit checking if our app-package can be installed locally with `devtools::install()` or `pak::local_install(upgrade = FALSE)` (depending on the IDE you're using).

[Install a package after the initial setup, after major changes to the code, documentation, or dependencies, and before committing or sharing.]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.10em; color: #5f2042;'}

[<code>devtools::install()</code>]{style="font-size: 1.15em; font-weight: bold;"}

### In RStudio ![](images/rstudio-icon.png){height=30}

<br>

`install()` will prompt the following output in the **Build** pane: 

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false 
==> R CMD INSTALL --preclean --no-multiarch --with-keep.source sap # <1>

* installing to library ‘/path/to/local/install/sap-090c61fc/R-4.2/x86_64-apple-darwin17.0’ # <2>

```
1. We saw both of these ` R CMD INSTALL` settings in the `sap.Rproj` file from the previous chapter  
2. Full file path for installation 
3. `install()` attempts to install the package from the `*source*` files and a 'bundle' or source tarball file (i.e., `.tar.gz`)
4.  `No man pages found in package 'sap'` tells us none of the code in `R/` has adequately been documented (which we'll cover in the `roxygen2` chapter)    
5. Building the `?help` files  
6. Checks to see if package can be loaded from multiple locations and stores 
7. Checks to see if package stores the install location 
8.  `DONE (sap)` means `sap` was successfully installed!

#### What's the difference? {.unnumbered}

`devtools::install()` focuses on helping package developers by managing all necessary steps for installation, including rebuilding documentation and running tests. `install()` also automatically updates outdated dependencies during installation unless `dependencies` is set to `FALSE`. 

`pak::local_install()` is designed to use parallel downloads and more efficient dependency resolution, making it faster and more reliable than `devtools::install()` in many cases.[^pak-performance] The `upgrade = FALSE` installs a package without upgrading its dependencies, keeping the current package versions intact.

[^pak-performance]: It stands to reason that installing a package with `pak::local_install()` in Positron would be faster than installing a package using `devtools::install()` in RStudio, but this has not been my experience. 

```{r}
#| label: git_box_04_devtools

  repo = 'sap')
```


## [Check?]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  {#sec-dev-check}

`devtools::check()` performs a series of checks to ensure a package meets the standards set by [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). You can consider `check()` as a 'quality control' function for documentation, `NAMESPACE` dependencies, unnecessary or non-standard folders and files, etc. [R Packages recommends](https://r-pkgs.org/workflow101.html#sec-workflow101-r-cmd-check) using `check()` often, but I agree with the advice in [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-packaging.html#r-cmd-check) on using `check()` with app-packages,

> *'I don't recommend that you [call `devtools::check()`] the first time, the second time, or even the third time you try out the package structure. Instead, I recommend that you get familiar with the basic structure and workflow before you take the next step to make a fully compliant package.'*

However, I've included an example of running `check()` on `sap` in the callout box below to demonstrate how it works.

::: {.callout-tip collapse='true' appearance="default"}

The output from `check()` can be rather lengthy (it's pretty comprehensive!), and it provides feedback on each item in the form of a note (`N`), warning (`W`), or error (`E`).

```{verbatim}

A summary of each item is below:

-   `checking top-level files`: This note refers to the two non-standard (i.e., not typically found in an R package) files, `app.R` and `movies.RData`.

-   `checking dependencies in R code`: This warning tells I need to namespace functions from add-on packages (in this case, `ggplot2`, `shiny`, and `stringr`)

-   `checking R code for possible problems`: This item refers to the call to load the `movies` data in the module server function (`mod_scatter_display_server`).

-   `checking for missing documentation entries`: This is warning me that the module functions aren't properly documented and refers me to the [official R documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Writing-R-documentation-files).

Each of these items is also printed under the `── R CMD check results` heading:

If you're submitting your app-package to CRAN (or want to use `check()` for other reasons), follow the [suggested workflow](https://r-pkgs.org/workflow101.html#check-workflow) for `check()`: 

> *The workflow for checking a package is simple, but tedious:*
> 
> 1. *Run `devtools::check()` or press* [<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>]{style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em"}
> 
> 2. *Fix the first problem.*
> 
> 3. *Repeat until there are no more problems*.' 

I've found a good habit for when to `check()` to be:

## Package versions

The `DESCRIPTION` file contains a boilerplate version number (`0.0.0.9000`) to signify it's a development package.[^pkg-dev-version] Generally speaking, R package development versions follow the [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) methods:

> *Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:*
> 
> *1. `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes*  
> *2. `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner*   
> *3. `PATCH` version when you make backward compatible bug fixes*  
> 
> *Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format.*

In this book, the package versions all begin with `0.0.0.9000`, because they should all be considered 'development' packages. However, I've included the chapter/section to align with the package version. So this chapter's version is: 

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false
Package: sap
Version: 0.0.0.9400
Type: Package
Title: Shiny App-Packages
Description: An R package with a collection of Shiny applications.

## Hidden files

You might notice additional 'hidden' files in your new app-package:[^hidden-files] `.gitignore`, `.Rbuildignore`, and `.Rprofile`: 

[^hidden-files]: By convention, files that begin with `.` ([dot files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory)) are considered hidden.

### `.gitignore` {#sec-dev-gitignore}

`.gitignore` will ignore some of the standard hidden files created by R or RStudio. The initial contents will include something like the following:

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
.DS_Store # for mac users 
```

### `.Rbuildignore` {#sec-dev-rbuildignore}

`.Rbuildignore` includes files that we need to have in our app-package, but don't conform to the standard R package structure (and shouldn't be included when building our app-package from the source files).

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
^.*\.Rproj$
^\.Rproj\.user$
```

*Note the syntax for detecting file patterns.*

### `.Rprofile` {#sec-dev-rprofile}

The `.Rprofile` is specific to the user (you) and might include options for loading packages or tests: 

```{r}
#| eval: false 
#| code-fold: false 
if (interactive()) {
  require(usethis, quietly = TRUE)
}
options(shiny.testmode = TRUE)
```

`.Rprofile` is also included in your directory if you're using `renv` to manage packages/versions.


## Recap {.unnumbered}

Creating an app-package involves adopting some new `devtools` [habits]{style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.0em;"}, and the initial contents of `sap` hopefully helped demonstrate the purpose of each function. 

```{r}
#| label: co_box_workflow_recap
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "g",
  look = "default", hsize = "1.10", size = "1.05",
  header = "Recap: Package development habits",
  contents = "
After installing and loading `devtools`: 
  
  1. [Load the package whenever changes occur in the `R/` folder]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.0em;'}.\n 
      - [<kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.75em'} load all the code in the package.\n
  
  2. [Document the package whenever changes are made to any `roxygen2` syntax or the `DESCRIPTION` file.]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.0em;'}.\n 
      - [<kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.75em'} record the documentation and dependencies.\n
  
  3. [Install the package after the initial setup, after major changes to the code, documentation, or dependencies, and before committing or sharing]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.0em;'}.\n  
      - [<kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.75em'} confirms the package can be installed.\n
      - `pak::local_install()` benefits from optimized dependency resolution and download methods 
      - `devtools::install()` handles a broader range of tasks during installation (including rebuilding documentation and running tests) 
  
Habits require repetition to develop, but things like keyboard shortcuts can help minimize the friction we all experience with change.

The following section will cover documenting functions with [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/)

```{r}
#| label: git_contrib_box
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_contrib_box()
