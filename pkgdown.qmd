The `pkgdown` package helps us easily create websites to enhance the visibility and usability of our app-package through a professional and informative website.
  
- Install `pkgdown`
  
- Run `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()` to set up the package and writes the configuration file (`_pkgdown.yml`)
  
- Customize `_pkgdown.yml` as needed, then 
  
- Run `pkgdown::build_site_github_pages()` to build your site 
  
- Push the changes to deploy it online for others to access!

In this chapter, we'll cover setting up a `pkgdown` website for our app-package. Building a package website isn't required, but it's a great way to confirm your package is documented and structured correctly, and it gives you an opportunity to share all of your hard work! `pkgdown` can be configured to automatically generate a beautiful website from a pre-specified Git branch GitHub Actions.

I've created the [`shinypak` R package](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/shinypak/) In an effort to make each section accessible and easy to follow:
  
Install `shinypak` using `pak` (or `remotes`):

```{r}
#| code-fold: false 
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| eval: false
# install.packages('pak')
pak::pak('mjfrigaard/shinypak')
```

Review the chapters in each section:
  
```{r}
#| code-fold: false 
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| collapse: true
library(shinypak)
list_apps(regex = 'pkgdown')
```

Launch an app: 

```{r}
#| code-fold: false 
#| eval: false
launch(app = "17_pkgdown")
```

## Setup {#sec-pkgdown-setup}

A `pkgdown` website makes our Shiny app and its accompanying package more accessible to potential users by providing them with a central location for any information they need (app features, updates, etc.). The magic of `pkgdown` is it's conversion of an existing R package structure into a website with documentation for our application.

``` r
install.packages("pkgdown")
```

`pkgdown` has a `usethis` function similar to `testthat` for setup:[^use-pkgdown-github-pages]

[^use-pkgdown-github-pages]: `usethis` also has a generic function for using `pkgdown` (`use_pkgdown()`), but we're going to cover building and deploying our app-package site using GitHub pages. Read more about `use_pkgdown()` in the [`usethis` documentation](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_pkgdown.html).

``` r
usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()
```

`use_pkgdown_github_pages()` takes care of (most of) the setup for our app-package website, but we'll break down the steps below.[^read-more-use-pkgdown-github_pages] I've replaced my GitHub username with `<username>` and the name of the app-package/repository with `<pkgName>`):

[^read-more-use-pkgdown-github_pages]: Internally, this function calls [`usethis::use_pkgdown()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_pkgdown.html), [`usethis::use_github_pages()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_github_pages.html), and [`usethis::use_github_action("pkgdown")`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_github_action.html). Read more in the [`usethis` documentation.](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/index.html)

### `_pkgdown.yml`

The initial output after running `use_pkgdown_github_pages()` looks something like the following:

``` sh
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/<username>/projects/<pkgName>'
✔ Adding '^_pkgdown\\.yml$', '^docs$', '^pkgdown$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding 'docs' to '.gitignore'
✔ Writing '_pkgdown.yml'
• Modify '_pkgdown.yml'
✔ Recording 'https://<username>.github.io/<pkgName>/' as site's url in '_pkgdown.yml'
✔ Adding 'https://<username>.github.io/<pkgName>/' to URL
✔ Setting 'https://<username>.github.io/<pkgName>/' as homepage of GitHub repo '<username>/<pkgName>'
```

`_pkgdown.yml` is initially created with only the `url`, `template`, and `bootstrap` version:

``` yml
url: https://<username>.github.io/<pkgName>/
template:
  bootstrap: 5

```

These fields are all that's required to launch your pkgdown site, but in the following sections we'll cover how to edit `_pkgdown.yml` to customize the fonts, colors, contents, and layout of our site.

### `gh-pages` branch

`use_pkgdown_github_pages()` sets up publishing our app-package site from an '*orphan branch from GitHub pages*':

``` sh
✔ Initializing empty, orphan 'gh-pages' branch in GitHub repo '<username>/<pkgName>'
✔ GitHub Pages is publishing from:
• URL: 'https://<username>.github.io/<pkgName>/'
• Branch: 'gh-pages'
```

```{r}
#| label: co_box_orphan_branch
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "g",
  look = "default", hsize = "1.15", size = "1.10",
  header = "![](images/github.jpg){width='35' height='35'} Orphan branches",
  fold = TRUE,
  contents = "
An orphan branch is a new Git branch with no commit history, effectively starting a new '`root`' in our project's development history. For our app-package, the `gh-pages` branch serves as a new line of development, completely separated from all other branches. 
  "
)
```



We're also told GitHub pages will be publishing our app-package website at the following URL: `https://<username>.github.io/<pkgName>/`

### `.github/workflows/`

`use_pkgdown_github_pages()` creates a GitHub Action workflow folder (`.github/workflows/`) with a  YAML file (`pkgdown.yaml`):

``` sh
• Path: '/'
✔ Creating '.github/'
✔ Adding '^\\.github$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding '*.html' to '.github/.gitignore'
✔ Creating '.github/workflows/'
✔ Saving 'r-lib/actions/examples/pkgdown.yaml@v2' to '.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml'
• Learn more at <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2/examples/README.md>.
```

We're also told the contents in this file are copied from the [r-lib/actions repository](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) (which we've covered previously in @sec-docker and @sec-gha).

## Build {#sec-pkgdown-site-contents}

`usethis` has two functions for building your pkgdown site: 

1. `build_site()` 
2. `build_site_github_pages()` 

We used `use_pkgdown_github_pages()` to configure our app-package, so we'll use `build_site_github_pages()` to build our site. 

``` r
pkgdown::build_site_github_pages()
```

In the following sections, we'll take a look at how the files and folders in our app-package are used to create the site's contents. As mentioned above, the great thing about `pkgdown` sites is that they use our existing package structure to build a beautiful site that's easy to navigate (with minimal changes).

### `docs/`

The `docs/` folder contains the .html files for our website (that's why `^docs$` was added to the `.Rbuildignore` and `docs` was added to the `.gitignore`). After creating a home for our site contents, the site initialization files are copied from the local `pkgdown` installation into `docs/`

``` sh
== Building pkgdown site ======================================================
Reading from: '/Users/<username>/<pkgName>'
Writing to:   '/Users/<username>/<pkgName>/docs'
```

###  `README.md` -> `index.html` 

The landing page (`index.html`) for our app-package website is built from the `README.md` file. An example of the site URL is below:

``` sh
https://<username>.github.io/<pkgName>/index.html
```

The `<username>` is our GitHub username, and the `<pkgName>` is the name of our package. The `authors.html` is built from the `Author` and `Maintainer` fields in the `DESCRIPTION` file. Long-form documentation can be stored in vignettes (@sec-use-vignette) which will be converted into articles (covered below). 

```{r}
#| label: co_box_use_readme_rmd
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "g",
  look = "default", hsize = "1.15", size = "1.10",
  header = "Standard README for your app-package",
  fold = TRUE,
  contents = 
"
If you'd like a boilerplate `README.md` for an R package, you can use `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`:

\`\`\` r
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
\`\`\`

\`\`\` bash
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/<username>/projects/<pkgName>'
✔ Writing 'README.Rmd'
✔ Adding '^README\\.Rmd$' to '.Rbuildignore'
• Modify 'README.Rmd'
✔ Writing '.git/hooks/pre-commit'
\`\`\`
  
At minimum, the `README.Rmd` should include: 

1. The purpose/goal of your app-package  
2. Instructions for installation   
3. Links to a deployed version (if applicable)  
4. Supporting packages 

If I chose to use this `README.md` file, I usually remove the `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (so they don't interfere with my personal add/commit/push process).

\`\`\` r
unlink('.git/hooks/pre-commit')
\`\`\`
")
```

### `man/` -> [Reference](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/moviesApp/reference/index.html)

The functions documented in the `man/` folder are converted into individual items in the **Reference** menu item (see @sec-doc). I've included two examples below:

:::: {layout="[50, 50]"  layout-valign="top"}

``` sh
man/
  ├── display_type.Rd
  └── ggp2_movies_app.Rd
```

``` sh
-- Building function reference ---------
Writing 'reference/index.html'
Reading 'man/display_type.Rd'
Writing 'reference/display_type.html'
Reading 'man/ggp2_movies_app.Rd'
Writing 'reference/ggp2_movies_app.html'
```

::::

- Functions will only be included in the **Reference** if they've been exported (see @sec-depends-exports) 

- If we've been thorough in documenting, the `@seealso` and `@family` tags will create hyperlinks between our utility functions, modules, UI/server/standalone app functions (see @sec-document-app-functions)

- The `@examples` will be run and displayed (@sec-doc-examples)

### `vignettes` -> [Articles](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/moviesApp/articles/moviesApp.html)

Any of the `.Rmd` in the `vignettes` folder will be rendered as HTML articles under the **Articles** menu item. The exception to this is any vignettes with the same name as our app-package (which will automatically be listed under a menu dropdown titled "Get Started"):[^get-started-vignette]

:::: {layout="[50, 50]"  layout-valign="top"}

``` sh
vignettes/
  ├── moviesApp.Rmd
  └── specs.Rmd
```

``` sh
-- Building articles -------------
Writing 'articles/index.html'
Reading 'vignettes/moviesApp.Rmd'
Writing 'articles/moviesApp.html'
Reading 'vignettes/specs.Rmd'
Writing 'articles/specs.html'
== DONE ==========================
```

::::

[^get-started-vignette]: I created this vignette with `usethis::use_vignette("moviesApp")` and included instructions for launching the various apps in `moviesApp`.

The final step in the build process is to add a `.nojekyll` file in the repository (this hidden file is necessary for `pkgdown` sites configured to deploy from GitHub pages).

``` sh
-- Extra files for GitHub pages ----------------------------------------------
Writing '.nojekyll'
```

## Layouts {#sec-pkgdown-layouts}

We can customize the look of our `pkgdown` site by editing the contents of `_pkgdown.yml`.

### Themes, colors and fonts

Below are some examples of the fields that control the [bootswatch theme](https://bootswatch.com/) (`<THEME>`), [code syntax highlighting](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/customise.html#syntax-highlighting)(`<HIGHLIGHTING>`):

:::: {layout="[50, 50]"  layout-valign="top"}

##### [YAML Fields]{style='font-weight: bold;'} {.unnumbered}

``` yml
template:
  bootstrap: 5
  bootswatch: <THEME>
  theme: <HIGHLIGHTING>

```

##### [In `_pkgdown.yml`]{style='font-weight: bold;'} {.unnumbered}

``` yml
template:
  bootstrap: 5
  bootswatch: united
  theme: atom-one-light
```

::::

We can use the [`bslib` package](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/any-project/index.html) for additional control over the fonts and colors on our site. The `<COLOR>` should be replaced with a color hex, and `<FONT>` can include any freely available [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).[^read-more-bslib]

[^read-more-bslib]: Read more about `bslib` in `pkgdown` sites in the [documentation.](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/customise.html#bslib-variables)

:::: {layout="[50, 50]"  layout-valign="top"}

##### [YAML Fields]{style='font-weight: bold;'} {.unnumbered}

``` yml

```

::::


You can see the theme, color, and font choices below: 

![pkgdown `template` in yml](images/pkgdown_template_yml.png){width='90%'}

### Articles

The articles should include a link to the landing page for our app, and provide detailed examples of how it works, including links to any additional resources or documentation.

The `navbar` components can also be customized with titles, sections, and article names. In `_pkgdown.yml`, the `articles` are listed under `components`, with a `text` title (`Docs`):

:::: {layout="[50, 50]"  layout-valign="top"}

##### [In `_pkgdown.yml`]{style='font-weight: bold;'} {.unnumbered}

``` yml
navbar:
 components:
   articles:
    text: Docs
```

##### [Output]{style='font-weight: bold;'} {.unnumbered}


![Navbar components](images/pkgdown_navbar_components.png)


::::

Any vignette with a filename that matches the package name is automatically named 'Getting Started' in the navbar. We can also add sections with article titles by placing them in `text` fields. These are listed under the `menu` (note the indentation), with a path to the `html` file. 

  -   Below I've listed the `App Specifications` vignette under a `"Specs"` section (see @sec-tests-specs), and linked to `articles/specs.html`:

:::: {layout="[50, 50]"  layout-valign="top"}

##### [In `_pkgdown.yml`]{style='font-weight: bold;'} {.unnumbered}

``` yml
    text: Docs
    menu:
    - text: "Specs"
    - text: App Specifications
      href: articles/specs.html
```

##### [Output]{style='font-weight: bold;'} {.unnumbered}


![Article sections](images/pkgdown_article_sections.png)



::::


Use `-------` with a `text` field to create horizontal separators between sections  (without a corresponding `href`). 

  -   I've added a `Features` section and a `Application Features` vignette (stored in `vignettes/features.Rmd` and published to `articles/features.html`):

:::: {layout="[50, 50]"  layout-valign="top"}

##### [In `_pkgdown.yml`]{style='font-weight: bold;'} {.unnumbered}

``` yml
    text: Docs
    menu:
    - text: "Specs"
    - text: App Specifications
      href: articles/specs.html
    - text: -------
    - text: "Features"
    - text: App Features
      href: articles/features.html
```

##### [Output]{style='font-weight: bold;'} {.unnumbered}

![Articles separator](images/pkgdown_article_separator.png)


::::

### Reference {#sec-pkgdown-referece}

`pkgdown` will automatically generate a **Reference** section for any object with an `.Rd` file in the `man/` folder. This includes functions we've explicitly exported with (i.e., with `@export`) *and* functions we've documented with `@keywords internal`.[^exported-funs]

[^exported-funs]: Functions with `@keywords internal` aren't listed in the package index, but can be accessed with `pkg:::fun()` (like the `test_logger()` function in `moviesApp`).

By default, the function are sorted alphabetically, but we can customize them into sections with titles and descriptions using the fields below in `_pkgdown.yml`:

``` yml
reference:
- title: "<TITLE>"
  desc: >
    <DESCRIPTION>
  contents:
  - <FUNCTION>
```

For example, we can include a section for the modules we're exporting from our app-package:

:::: {layout="[50, 50]"  layout-valign="top"}

##### [In `_pkgdown.yml`]{style='font-weight: bold;'} {.unnumbered}

``` yml
reference:
- title: "Modules"
  desc: >
    App modules
```

##### [Output]{style='font-weight: bold;'} {.unnumbered}

![](images/pkgdown_fun_title_desc_mods.png){width='100%' fig-align='center'}

::::


```{r}
#| label: co_box_list_all_funs_reference
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "o",
  look = "default", hsize = "1.15", size = "1.10",
  header = "Customizing **`Reference`**",
  fold = TRUE,
  contents = 
"
The `_pkgdown.yml` file **must include all exported functions if you customize the `reference` field**. If not, you'll see an error when you try to build your site:

\`\`\` bash
-- Building function reference ------------------------------------
Error in `check_missing_topics()`:
! All topics must be included in reference index
✖ Missing topics: <FUN>
ℹ Either add to _pkgdown.yml or use @keywords internal
\`\`\`
  
")
```

To help organize and display the functions in your app-package, we can use `tidyselect` helpers[^tidyselect] in the bullets below `contents`. 

For example, we can list modules with `starts_with("mod")`:[^prefix-names]

[^prefix-names]: Using the `mod_` as a prefix for module functions is a habit I've adopted from the [`golem` package](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) (specifically, the [`add_module()` function](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/reference/add_module.html)).

[^tidyselect]: Read more about how to build the function reference [here](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html#reference)

## `pkgdown` workflow {#sec-pkgdown-workflow}

The `.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml` file automates building and deploying our app-package's `pkgdown` site. This workflow file is configured to be triggered by specific GitHub events, build the website using the standard package files, then deploys it to GitHub Pages. Below we'll breakdown the fields and values of the workflow (and their functions):

### Triggers

::::{layout="[50, 50]"  layout-valign="center"}

[1.  Set to trigger **`on`** `push`es or `pull_request`s made to the `main` or `master` branches (__we'll change these to only trigger on the `17_pkgdown` branch__).]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}


``` yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]
```

::::

::::{layout="[-3, 47, 50]"  layout-valign="center"}

   [a.  Also triggers when a `release` is published, allowing the website to showcase the latest version of the package.[^releases]]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}
  
[^releases]: [*"You can create releases to bundle and deliver iterations of a project to users."*](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release)

``` yml
  release:
    types: [published]
```

::::

::::{layout="[-3, 47, 50]"  layout-valign="center"}

   [b.  `workflow_dispatch`  allows the workflow to be manually triggered from the GitHub Actions web interface (for ad-hoc updates).[^manual-runs]]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}
  
[^manual-runs]: [*"To enable a workflow to be triggered manually, you need to configure the `workflow_dispatch` event."*](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch)

``` yml
  workflow_dispatch:
```

::::

### Jobs

::::{layout="[50, 50]"  layout-valign="center"}

[2.  **`name`** defines a single job with the ID `pkgdown`.]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}

``` yml
name: pkgdown
```

::::

::::{layout="[50, 50]"  layout-valign="center"}

[3.  **`jobs`** specifies the job ID (`pkgdown`) and runs the job on the latest Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub Actions.]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}

``` yml
jobs:
  pkgdown:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

::::

[4.  The comment *`# Only restrict concurrency for non-PR jobs`* refers to the **`concurrency`** field,[^concurrency] which prevents *concurrent* runs of the job for non-pull request events (avoiding conflicts or redundant deployments).]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}
    [a. `group`[^group] uses a dynamic expression to differentiate between `pull_request` events and `github.event_name`, using the run ID (`github.run_id`) for pull requests to allow concurrency.]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}

[^concurrency]: [*"Use concurrency to ensure that only a single job or workflow using the same concurrency group will run at a time."*](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency)
    
[^group]: [*"Concurrency groups provide a way to manage and limit the execution of workflow runs or jobs that share the same concurrency key."*](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-concurrency-groups)

``` yml
    concurrency:
      group: pkgdown-${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' || github.run_id }}
```

[5.  **`env`** sets the `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable using the GitHub token, `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` (which allows the workflow to authenticate and perform operations within the repository).]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}

``` yml
    env:
      GITHUB_PAT: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

:::: {layout="[50, 50]" layout-valign="center"}

[6.  **`permissions`** explicitly grants the workflow `write` permissions to the repository, enabling it to push changes (like an updated website).]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}

``` yml
    permissions:
      contents: write
```

::::

### Steps

:::: {layout="[50, 50]" layout-valign="center"}

[7.  Checks out the repository's code, making it available to subsequent **`steps`**.]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}

``` yml
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

::::

:::: {layout="[50, 50]" layout-valign="center"}

[8. Installs **`pandoc`**, which is necessary for rendering markdown documents and vignettes.]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}

``` yml
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-pandoc@v2
```

::::

:::: {layout="[50, 50]" layout-valign="center"}

[9. Sets up the R environment and configures it to use the public RStudio package manager (**`use-public-rspm`**) for faster package installations.]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}

``` yml
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
      with:
        use-public-rspm: true
```

::::

:::: {layout="[50, 50]" layout-valign="center"}

[10. Installs the **`dependencies`** required by our app-package and `pkgdown`.]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}

``` yml
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2
```

::::

:::: {layout="[-3, 47, 50]" layout-valign="center"}

   [a. Specifies installing **`any::`**thing from `pkgdown` and the **`local::`** package (our app-package).[^needs]]{style="font-size: 0.90rem;"}

[^needs]: The **`needs: website`** fields might be a placeholder? I'm unaware of the **`needs`** keyword applied within a **`with`** clause for setting up dependencies. This also could be intended as a comment or note for future adjustments...

``` yml
      with:
        extra-packages: any::pkgdown, local::.
        needs: website

`.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml` performs more operations than the previous workflows. However, these extra steps allow us to use the `gh-pages` branch to maintain and showcase up-to-date package documentation for users, contributors, and collaborators. When we're happy with the layout of our website in `_pkgdown.yml`, we can add, commit, and push the changes back to the repo: 

``` sh
git add .
git commit -m "updates to _pkgdown.yml"
git push
```

## GitHub {#sec-pkgdown-github}

Back in GitHub, we can see our previous **Style** (@sec-gha-style), **shiny** (@sec-gha-shiny), and **docker-shiny, moviesapp** (@sec-gha-shiny-docker) workflows:

![](images/gha_all_workflows.png){width='100%'}


```{r}
#| label: git_box_17_pkgdown
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_margin_box(
  contents = "launch",
  fig_pw = '75%', 
  branch = "17_pkgdown", 
  repo = 'moviesApp')
```

After pushing the changes to the `17_pkgdown` branch, a new workflow is created in the **Actions** tab:

![New workflow created on `push` to `17_pkgdown` branch](images/pkgdown_new_workflow.png)

The `workflow` file triggers the following steps:

![GitHub Pages Deploy Action](images/pkgdown_gh_deploy_pkgdown.png){width='100%'}

-   The process begins with checking the necessary configurations for deployment and using the `Deploy Token… 🔑` for authentication. 

    ``` sh
    Checking configuration and starting deployment… 🚦
    Deploying using Deploy Token… 🔑
    ```
  
-   Git is set up and configured (similar to a new user) with user credentials (`<username>` and `<username>@pm.me`), but also includes:
    -   setting up a safe directory (`--add safe.directory`), 
    -   ignoring case (`config core.ignorecase false`), 
    -   removing any extra headers (`http.https://github.com/.extraheader`), and 
    -   adding remote origin to point to the GitHub repository where the `moviesApp` package resides (`remote add origin`).

    ``` sh
    Configuring git…
    /usr/bin/git config --global --add safe.directory /home/runner/work/<pkgName>/<pkgName>
    /usr/bin/git config user.name <username>
    /usr/bin/git config user.email <username>@pm.me
    /usr/bin/git config core.ignorecase false
    /usr/bin/git config --local --unset-all http.https://github.com/.extraheader
    /usr/bin/git remote rm origin
    /usr/bin/git remote add origin ***github.com/<username>/<pkgName>.git
    Git configured… 🔧
    ```
-   The workflow checks for an existing `gh-pages` branch in the repository (which is the branch we've configured to serve the website content).

    ``` sh
    Starting to commit changes…
    /usr/bin/git ls-remote --heads ***github.com/<username>/<pkgName>.git refs/heads/gh-pages
    7cac1013e4a324d943d2b33ed6d52f0cf6b243a6    refs/heads/gh-pages
    ```
-   A Git `worktree`[^worktree] is created for the `gh-pages` branch, which allows multiple branches within the same repository (without having to clone the repository again). 
    -   The worktree is prepared in a `detached HEAD` state, and then the `gh-pages` branch is checked out:

    ``` sh
    Creating worktree…
    /usr/bin/git fetch --no-recurse-submodules --depth=1 origin gh-pages
    From https://github.com/<username>/<pkgName>
     * branch            gh-pages   -> FETCH_HEAD
     * [new branch]      gh-pages   -> origin/gh-pages
    /usr/bin/git worktree add --no-checkout --detach github-pages-deploy-action-temp-deployment-folder
    Preparing worktree (detached HEAD 742bb18)
    /usr/bin/git checkout -B gh-pages origin/gh-pages
    ```
-   The website content generated by `pkgdown` in the `docs` directory is copied into the worktree directory, ensuring that all necessary files are updated with the latest changes:
    -   `chmod` is used to 'change access permissions'[^chmod]  
    -   `-R` applies the permission changes to the directory specified *and* to all of the subdirectories and files   
    -   `+rw` adds both read and write permissions for the user, group, and others to the files/directories targeted by this command

    ``` sh
    /usr/bin/chmod -R +rw /home/runner/work/<pkgName>/<pkgName>/docs
    /usr/bin/rsync -q -av --checksum --progress /home/runner/work/<pkgName>/<pkgName>/docs/. github-pages-deploy-action-temp-deployment-folder --exclude .ssh --exclude .git --exclude .github
    ```
-   The changes are added, committed, and then force-pushed to the `gh-pages` branch:
    -   The content is updated to reflect the latest version of the website associated the `moviesApp` R package  
    -   The commit message includes a deployment tag and the hash of the commit from the deployment   

    ``` sh
    Checking if there are files to commit…
    /usr/bin/git add --all .
    /usr/bin/git checkout -b github-pages-deploy-action/kpvxdgnej
    Switched to a new branch 'github-pages-deploy-action/kpvxdgnej'
    Force-pushing changes...
    /usr/bin/git push --force ***github.com/<username>/<pkgName>.git github-pages-deploy-action/kpvxdgnej:gh-pages
    To https://github.com/<username>/<pkgName>.git
       7cac101..aab5105  github-pages-deploy-action/kpvxdgnej -> gh-pages
    Changes committed to the gh-pages branch… 📦
    ```
    
-   After successfully pushing the changes to the `gh-pages` branch, the workflow performs `cleanup jobs`:
    -   reset the branch pointer, and   
    -   remove the temporary worktree directory   

    ``` sh
    Running post deployment cleanup jobs… 🗑️
    /usr/bin/git checkout -B github-pages-deploy-action/kpvxdgnej
    Reset branch 'github-pages-deploy-action/kpvxdgnej'
    /usr/bin/chmod -R +rw github-pages-deploy-action-temp-deployment-folder
    /usr/bin/git worktree remove github-pages-deploy-action-temp-deployment-folder --force
    ```

-   The workflow finishes and signals the deployment has been successfully completed.

    ``` sh
    Completed deployment successfully! ✅
    ```
    
Back in the **Actions** tab, we see a new **pages build and deployment** workflow has been created with a 'bot' tag:

![](images/pkgdown_pages_build_deployment_workflow.png){width='100%'}

The **updates to \_pkgdown.yml** workflow represents the changes we committed and pushed to the `17_pkgdown` branch (`#10`), but we configured our website to be served from the `gh-pages` branch (`#11`). Each time we push changes to `17_pkgdown` and trigger the **pkgdown** workflow, a corresponding **pages build and deployment** workflow will be triggered to build and deploy the site:

![Build and deploy `pkgdown` site](images/pkgdown_pages_build_deployment.png)


This automated deployment process is essential for maintaining up-to-date documentation or website content for R packages (like `moviesApp`) without manual intervention, making it easier for developers to focus on development while ensuring that users always have access to the latest information.

**`pkgdown`** is handy for creating beautiful, functional websites for your app-package. Package sites help share your app-package with others in a more engaging and informative way.
  
  - **Installation**
  
    \`\`\` r
    install.packages('pkgdown)`
    \`\`\`

  - **Setup**: create a configuration file that `pkgdown` will use to build your site with one of the `usethis` functions below: 
  
    \`\`\` r
    usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()
    # or
    # usethis::use_pkgdown() 
    \`\`\`
  
    - These create a `_pkgdown.yml` configuration file that lets us customize how our site looks and which parts of our app-package are diplayed/highlighted.
  
  - **Customize**: we can change our `pkgdown` site theme, set colors and fonts, organize the navigation bar, and add custom sections and pages. For an app-package, this means we can create a landing page for our Shiny app, provide detailed articles on how it works, and link to any additional resources or documentation.

  - **Building Your Site** 
  
    \`\`\` r
    pkgdown::build_site_github_pages()
    # or 
    # pkgdown::build_site()
    \`\`\`
  
  -  `build_site_github_pages()` goes through our app-package (function documentation, and examples, RMarkdown vignettes, README, NEWS, etc.) and assembles a coherent, navigable site.
  
  - **Deploying Your Site**: after building a `pkgdown` site, we can use GitHub Actions to upload the generated website contents to GitHub Pages, which hosts our app-package site directly from a GitHub repository.
