    "text": "What’s in the book\nThis book is a resource to help ‘connect the dots’ between building scalable Shiny applications and writing R packages. Adopting R package development practices in the early stages of your Shiny app will improve the reusability, maintainability, and shareability of all your hard work.\nThe code and data originate from the excellent Building Web Applications with Shiny (BWAS) course. If you’re new to Shiny development this course is a great place to start. The four learning modules will provide a solid understanding for many of the topics covered in this book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM Disclaimer: who wrote this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the current landscape of online resources and the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs), I feel it’s important to clarify the authorship of this book.\nOnly the code included in this book was created with the assistance of LLMs, and this applies only to specific chapters that are explicitly noted. I have fully authored the narrative, commentary, and explanations. Hopefully, the typos and/or grammatical errors serve as a signature of authenticity.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Updates!\nThis resource is being revised to include recent changes in the Shiny development landscape (Positron, LLM tools and packages, etc.). While most of the information in the Introduction and App-packages sections will remain unchanged, I will continue to update the other sections as Shiny app (and R package) development evolves and changes.

However, R Packages, 2ed primarily focuses on creating conventional R packages, so it doesn’t cover Shiny programming (designing user interfaces, server-side computations, modules, etc.). Moreover, testing and debugging a Shiny application differs from the traditional methods used in R packages.\nMastering Shiny is an excellent introduction to the world of Shiny and provides a foundation of best practices for developing applications. R packages are introduced near the end of Mastering Shiny, and this chapter is a great place to start.1 However, to fully understand and appreciate the benefits of developing your Shiny app as an R package, it’s helpful to have an example app-package that includes the full suite of the package development tools (loading, documenting, testing, installing, etc.).2",

Two popular resources are Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps and Outstanding User Interfaces with Shiny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps introduces the golem package, which is an ‘opinionated framework for building production-grade Shiny applications’. golem offers a robust and standardized way to build, maintain, and deploy production-grade Shiny apps. Whether due to the learning curve, number of features, dependencies, or a particular set of deployment constraints, golem might not be the right fit for your application.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding User Interfaces with Shiny ‘addresses a specific gap between the beginner and advanced level’ focusing on customizing your Shiny application with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It introduces charpente, which streamlines the creation of Shiny development by quickly creating an R package, importing external web dependencies for JavaScript and CSS, initializing input/output bindings, and providing custom handler boilerplates. charpente also offers a high-level interface to htmltools (the workhorse that converts R code to web-friendly HTML).\n\n\n\nWe’ll cover both of these texts more in the frameworks section.",

Specifically, the package development tools provided in the Build pane and the devtools package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositron is Posit’s new integrated development environment (IDE) designed to improve productivity and performance across multiple programming languages.

When I’m including information specific to particular IDE, I will use icons to differentiate Positron from RStudio ( vs. ).\n\nOther tools\nDeveloping R packages in RStudio or Positron is not required. There are alternative IDEs and tools, and many developers employ these setups (VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Lab, Colab, etc). Package development outside RStudio would look almost identical to development in the IDE:\n\nCreate the package structure (R/ folder for .R scripts, man/ folder for documentation, data/ folder for datasets, etc.)\nCreate DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files, etc.\nEnsure the package can be installed and loaded into an R session.\n\nThe development workflow functions we’ll cover work just about anywhere you can execute R code (i.e., roxygen2::roxygenize(), devtools::load_all(), devtools::install(), etc.).",

    "section": "How to read this book",
    "text": "How to read this book\nTransitioning from programming in R to building Shiny applications and writing R packages presents a steep learning curve. The chapters in this book are aimed flattening the package development portion of that curve. As with any new skill, app-package development involves new mental models, concepts, terminology, habits, and details. If you find yourself getting frustrated, I recommend the 15 minute rule:\n\n“By forcing yourself to try for 15 minutes, you gain a deeper understanding of what you’re troubleshooting so that, even if you don’t fix it in 15, next time you’re in a better position to troubleshoot than you were the last time.\nAnd by forcing yourself to ask for help after 15, you not only limit the amount of banging-your-head time, but you also get to see how the other person solves the problem while all the details are still fresh in your mind, so that you’ll more likely have a deeper understanding of why what you were doing to fix it wasn’t working, and why the ultimate solution actually worked.” - Hacker News, 2013\n\nThe chapters in this book (roughly) represent the steps of R package development, but through the lens of an existing Shiny application.4 Each topic can be applied to creating a new app-package, but–in my experience–many Shiny developers have existing applications they’d like to convert into an R package.\n\nThe stable stuff\nThe first two sections contain topics that aren’t likely to change anytime soon. Introduction covers the development of a Shiny app project and it’s gradual progression of complexity to warrant an R package. The app-packages section applies the key components of R package development to a Shiny app.\n\n1  Whole app game is a ‘whole game’ for the development of a toy app-package. This chapter gives a high-level overview of the app-package development workflow.5\nIn 2  Shiny we’ll dive into shiny development, focusing on the files and folders found in most Shiny applications.\nR packages are introduced in 3  Packages, and it covers the differences between Shiny app projects, R packages, and Shiny app-packages.\n4  Development introduces devtools and the app-package development workflow.\n5  Documentation covers documenting the application’s utility functions, modules, UI, server, and standalone app function using roxygen2.\nManaging dependencies (both imports and exports) using the NAMESPACE file is introduced in 6  Dependencies\n7  Data discusses the storage, format, and documentation of data files your app-package.\nThere are multiple ways to launch an application from an app-package. 8  Launch covers options to include in the app.R file and your standalone app function.\n9  Resources covers the many uses of the inst/ folder in R packages. This chapter also covers how to add external files and resources to your application.\n\n\n\nThe opinionated bits\nThe sections below represent my approach to developing app-packages. Most of these practices come from the same resources referenced above, but there are many ways to debug and test your code.\nDebugging is an important part of development, both for R packages and Shiny apps. This section contains chapters on using an interactive debugger and other methods for ensuring you can reliably investigate and address bugs in your code quickly and effectively.\n\n10  Debuggers covers\n11  Print debugging explains\n12  Debugging apps gives\n13  Logging describes\n\nWhile developing your application, you’ll want to ensure it’s features are documented and tested. The Tests section covers testing:\n\nBefore running any tests we need to set up the test suite in our app-package. 14  Test suite briefly covers setting up the testing infrastructure with testthat.\nKnowing what features to implement and what tests to develop reduces the chances of writing code that doesn’t address a user needs. 15  Specifications discusses how to identify user specifications, features, and functional requirements. It also briefly introduces behavior-driven development.\n16  Test tools covers how to include testing tools (fixtures and helpers) in your test suite to ensure isolated yet controllable test conditions.\nReactivity makes testing modules tricky. In 17  Testing modules, I’ll cover some strategies and approaches for verifying that your modules are communicating correctly with Shiny’s testServer() function.\n18  System tests introduces performing system (or end-to-end) tests in you app-package with the shinytest2 package.\n\nAfter you’ve developed your Shiny App-Package, you’ll likely want to deploy it (or put it ‘into production’). A selection of popular methods are covered in Deploy:\n\n20  Docker explains how build Docker images and containers using Docker desktop. These topics are also covered in 23  golem.\n21  GitHub Actions covers continuous integration (CI) / continuous deployment (CD) for Shiny app-packages using GitHub Actions.\n22  pkgdown websites are an excellent way to enhance it’s visibility and usability of your app-package (and it’s made seamless with usethis and GitHub actions (see 22.4 Deploying your site)).\n\n\n\nStuff from the web\nIf you’re Googling ‘what is the best way to build a Shiny application?’ you’ll eventually encounter a Shiny framework. This section contains the development workflow and methods for three popular Shiny application frameworks (golem, leprechaun, charpente and rhino).\n\n23  golem covers developing an application using the golem framework (which is introduced in Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps).\nFor developers looking for a ‘lightweight’ version of the golem package, 24  leprechaun introduces the leprechaun package and development workflow\n25  rhino covers how to build a rhino application (which is not technically a package, but is still worth including based on it’s popularity and features).\n\n\n\nExtras\nThe special topics section includes a handful of topics on development, AI tools, storing and retrieving data, reading error outputs, and keeping track of dependencies.\n\n33  🏗️ App data explores the differences between and use of shiny::reactiveValues() and session$userData.\nAppendix H — 🏗️ Stack traces (this chapter is under construction)\n35  🏗️ Dependency hell (this chapter is under construction)",

When developing Shiny apps for production deployment, it’s important to remember that the code will likely be accessed and used by others.\nTo quote Marie Kondo, the de-cluttering expert,\n\n“Ensuring that each one of your belongings has its own spot is the only way to maintain a tidy and clutter-free home. Clutter has nothing to do with what or how much you own – it’s the failure to put things back where they belong.”\n\nR packages simplify sharing your work with colleagues by eliminating the need for them to determine where everything is located, how everything connects, and how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to ‘put something into production?’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Production’ usually means passing the code from your personal development environment into your company’s cloud-based server environment, which typically involves bundling your app in a structure that can be shared, installed, tested, and launched.\n\n‘I think the easiest way to think about it for me is that we develop a model in one computational environment–think of this as maybe your laptop or maybe you work in a server environment–still, it’s in one place, and it turns out the software that you need to have installed there is about tuning, training, etc. Putting something into production is getting it out of that computational environment and successfully carrying it over to a new computational environment. For many people, this might be like a cloud computing environment. It might be some kind of server your organization has, and we need to take it, lift it, and then successfully have it working.’ - Julia Silge, What is ‘production’ anyway?

This preparation helps us successfully organize our Shiny apps into R packages.\n\n2.2.1 app.R\nThe code below replaces our boilerplate ‘Old Faith Geyser Data’ app in app.R:\n\n\nshow/hide movie review Shiny app\nui &lt;- shiny::fluidPage(\n  theme = shinythemes::shinytheme(\"spacelab\"),\n  shiny::sidebarLayout(\n    shiny::sidebarPanel(\n      shiny::selectInput(\n        inputId = \"y\",\n        label = \"Y-axis:\",\n        choices = c(\n          \"IMDB rating\" = \"imdb_rating\",\n          \"IMDB number of votes\" = \"imdb_num_votes\",\n          \"Critics Score\" = \"critics_score\",\n          \"Audience Score\" = \"audience_score\",\n          \"Runtime\" = \"runtime\"\n        ),\n        selected = \"audience_score\"\n      ),\n      shiny::selectInput(\n        inputId = \"x\",\n        label = \"X-axis:\",\n        choices = c(\n          \"IMDB rating\" = \"imdb_rating\",\n          \"IMDB number of votes\" = \"imdb_num_votes\",\n          \"Critics Score\" = \"critics_score\",\n          \"Audience Score\" = \"audience_score\",\n          \"Runtime\" = \"runtime\"\n        ),\n        selected = \"critics_score\"\n      ),\n      shiny::selectInput(\n        inputId = \"z\",\n        label = \"Color by:\",\n        choices = c(\n          \"Title Type\" = \"title_type\",\n          \"Genre\" = \"genre\",\n          \"MPAA Rating\" = \"mpaa_rating\",\n          \"Critics Rating\" = \"critics_rating\",\n          \"Audience Rating\" = \"audience_rating\"\n        ),\n        selected = \"mpaa_rating\"\n      ),\n      shiny::sliderInput(\n        inputId = \"alpha\",\n        label = \"Alpha:\",\n        min = 0, max = 1,\n        value = 0.4\n      ),\n      shiny::sliderInput(\n        inputId = \"size\",\n        label = \"Size:\",\n        min = 0, max = 5,\n        value = 3\n      ),\n      shiny::textInput(\n        inputId = \"plot_title\",\n        label = \"Plot title\",\n        placeholder = \"Enter text to be used as plot title\"\n      ),\n      shiny::actionButton(\n        inputId = \"update_plot_title\",\n        label = \"Update plot title\"\n      )\n    ),\n    shiny::mainPanel(\n      shiny::br(),\n      shiny::p(\n        \"These data were obtained from\",\n        shiny::a(\"IMBD\", href = \"http://www.imbd.com/\"), \"and\",\n        shiny::a(\"Rotten Tomatoes\", href = \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/\"), \".\"\n      ),\n      shiny::p(\n        \"The data represent\",\n        nrow(movies),\n        \"randomly sampled movies released between 1972 to 2014 in the United States.\"\n      ),\n      shiny::plotOutput(outputId = \"scatterplot\"),\n      shiny::hr(),\n      shiny::p(shiny::em(\n        \"The code for this Shiny application comes from\",\n        shiny::a(\"Building Web Applications with shiny\",\n          href = \"https://rstudio-education.github.io/shiny-course/\"\n        )\n      ))\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  new_plot_title &lt;- shiny::reactive({\n    tools::toTitleCase(input$plot_title)\n  }) |&gt;\n    shiny::bindEvent(input$update_plot_title,\n      ignoreNULL = FALSE,\n      ignoreInit = FALSE\n    )\n\n\n  output$scatterplot &lt;- shiny::renderPlot({\n    scatter_plot(\n      df = movies,\n      x_var = input$x,\n      y_var = input$y,\n      col_var = input$z,\n      alpha_var = input$alpha,\n      size_var = input$size\n    ) +\n      ggplot2::labs(title = new_plot_title()) +\n      ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n      ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n  })\n}\n\nshiny::shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Utility functions\nI’ve converted ggplot2 server code into a scatter_plot() utility function:\n\n\nshow/hide scatter_plot()\nscatter_plot &lt;- function(df, x_var, y_var, col_var, alpha_var, size_var) {\n    ggplot2::ggplot(data = df,\n      ggplot2::aes(x = .data[[x_var]],\n          y = .data[[y_var]],\n          color = .data[[col_var]])) +\n      ggplot2::geom_point(alpha = alpha_var, size = size_var)\n\n}\n\n\nThis function is stored in a new utils.R file:\n\n\n2.2.3 Data\nThe movies.RData dataset contains reviews from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes.

    "text": "2.5 Code\nThe following two items are considered best practices because they make your app more scalable by converting app.R into functions.\n\n2.5.1 Modules\nShiny modules are a ‘pair of UI and server functions’ designed to compartmentalize input and output IDs into distinct namespaces,\n\n‘…a namespace is to an ID as a directory is to a file…’ - shiny::NS() help file\n\nModule UI functions usually combine the layout, input, and output functions using tagList(). Module server functions handle the ‘backend’ logic within a Shiny server function. UI and server module functions are connected through an id argument. The UI function creates this id with NS() (namespace), and the server function uses moduleServer() to call it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule Code Snippet\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a code snippet for quickly creating module UI and server functions in RStudio.\nsnippet module\n    #' ${1:name} shiny module (UI)\n    #' \n    #' @param id shiny module id\n    mod_${1:name}_ui &lt;- function(id) {\n        ns &lt;- NS(id)\n            tagList(\n        \n            )\n        }\n    #' ${1:name} shiny module (server)\n    #' \n    #' @param id shiny module id\n    mod_${1:name}_server &lt;- function(id) {\n        moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n            ns &lt;- session\\$ns\n            \n        })\n    }\n    # Copy in UI\n    # mod_${1:name}_ui('id')\n    # Copy in server\n    # mod_${1:name}_server('id')\n\n\n\n\n2.5.1.1 Inputs\nThe mod_var_input_ui() function creates a list of inputs (column names and graph aesthetics) in the UI:\n\n\nshow/hide mod_var_input_ui()\nmod_var_input_ui &lt;- function(id) {\n  ns &lt;- shiny::NS(id)\n  shiny::tagList(\n    shiny::selectInput(\n1      inputId = ns(\"y\"),\n      label = \"Y-axis:\",\n      choices = c(\n        \"IMDB rating\" = \"imdb_rating\",\n        \"IMDB number of votes\" = \"imdb_num_votes\",\n        \"Critics Score\" = \"critics_score\",\n        \"Audience Score\" = \"audience_score\",\n        \"Runtime\" = \"runtime\"\n      ),\n      selected = \"audience_score\"\n    ),\n    shiny::selectInput(\n2      inputId = ns(\"x\"),\n      label = \"X-axis:\",\n      choices = c(\n        \"IMDB rating\" = \"imdb_rating\",\n        \"IMDB number of votes\" = \"imdb_num_votes\",\n        \"Critics Score\" = \"critics_score\",\n        \"Audience Score\" = \"audience_score\",\n        \"Runtime\" = \"runtime\"\n      ),\n      selected = \"imdb_rating\"\n    ),\n    shiny::selectInput(\n3      inputId = ns(\"z\"),\n      label = \"Color by:\",\n      choices = c(\n        \"Title Type\" = \"title_type\",\n        \"Genre\" = \"genre\",\n        \"MPAA Rating\" = \"mpaa_rating\",\n        \"Critics Rating\" = \"critics_rating\",\n        \"Audience Rating\" = \"audience_rating\"\n      ),\n      selected = \"mpaa_rating\"\n    ),\n    shiny::sliderInput(\n4      inputId = ns(\"alpha\"),\n      label = \"Alpha:\",\n      min = 0, max = 1, step = 0.1,\n      value = 0.5\n    ),\n    shiny::sliderInput(\n5      inputId = ns(\"size\"),\n      label = \"Size:\",\n      min = 0, max = 5,\n      value = 2\n    ),\n    shiny::textInput(\n6      inputId = ns(\"plot_title\"),\n      label = \"Plot title\",\n      placeholder = \"Enter plot title\"\n    )\n  )\n}\n\n\n\n1\n\ny axis numeric variable\n\n2\n\nx axis numeric variable\n\n3\n\nz axis categorical variable\n\n\n4\n\nalpha numeric value for points\n\n\n5\n\nsize numeric value for size\n\n\n6\n\nplot_title text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'monospace',\"fontSize\":\"16px\"}}}%%\nflowchart TD\n    User([\"User\"])\n    subgraph mod_var_input_server[\"&lt;strong&gt;mod_var_input_server()&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        XServer[\\\"input$x\"\\]\n        YServer[\\\"input$y\"\\]\n        ZServer[\\\"input$z\"\\]\n        AlphaServer[\\\"input$alpha\"\\]\n        SizeServer[\\\"input$size\"\\]\n        TitleServer[\\\"input$plot_title\"\\]\n    end\n    subgraph mod_var_input_ui[\"&lt;strong&gt;mod_var_input_ui()&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        XUI[/\"X-axis\"/]\n        YUI[/\"Y-axis\"/]\n        ZUI[/\"Color by\"/]\n        AlphaUI[/\"Alpha\"/]\n        SizeUI[/\"Size\"/]\n        TitleUI[/\"Plot title\"/]\n    end\n    User --&gt;

    "text": "3.1.1 Essential ingredients\nIf you’ve done some research on R packages, you’ve probably encountered one (or both) of the following statements,\n\n‘RStudio and devtools consider any directory containing DESCRIPTION to be a package’ - R Packages, 2ed (Chapter 9, DESCRIPTION)\n‘all a project needs to be a package is a directory of R/ files and a DESCRIPTION file.’ - Mastering Shiny (Chapter 20, Packages)\n\nBelow is the current sap app folder:\n\nsap/\n1├── DESCRIPTION\n├── sap.Rproj \n2├── R/\n│   ├── mod_scatter_display.R\n│   ├── mod_var_input.R\n│   └── utils.R\n├── README.md\n├── app.R\n├── movies.RData\n└── www/\n    └── shiny.png\n\n4 directories, 9 files\n\n\n1\n\nDESCRIPTION file\n\n\n2\n\nR/ folder with .R files\n\n\n\n\nWe can see sap has:\n\na DESCRIPTION file\nan R/ directory\n\nSo, is sap a functioning R package?\n\n3.1.1.1 Can we load it with devtools?\nPackage development kicks off with the load_all() function from devtools, which is similar to calling library() (we’ll cover this function extensively in the Development chapter).\nHowever, when we attempt to load the code in the R/ folder with load_all(), we see the following error:\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\nlibrary(devtools)\ndevtools::load_all()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevtools is looking for the Package field in our DESCRIPTION file\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Does it have a DESCRIPTION?\n\n\nLaunch app with the shinypak package:\n\nlaunch('03.1_description')\n\nThe official R documentation5 lists the following required fields for the DESCRIPTION in R packages:\n\nThe ‘Package’, ‘Version’, ‘License’, ‘Description’, ‘Title’, ‘Author’, and ‘Maintainer’ fields are mandatory.\n\nBelow is an example DESCRIPTION file for our new sap package with the mandatory fields:6\n\nPackage: sap\nTitle: Shiny App-Packages\nVersion: 0.0.0.9000\nAuthor: John Smith [aut, cre]\nMaintainer: John Smith &lt;John.Smith@email.io&gt;\nDescription: An R package with a collection of Shiny applications.\nLicense: GPL-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor and Maintainer fields\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the Author and Maintainer fields require additional information beyond first and last name (i.e., John Smith). These can be created with the utils::person() function:\n\n# Author\nutils::person(\n  given = \"John\", \n  family = \"Smith\", \n  role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"))\n## [1] \"John Smith [aut, cre]\"\n# Maintainer\nutils::person(\n  given = \"John\", \n  family = \"Smith\", \n  email = \"John.Smith@email.io\")\n## [1] \"John Smith &lt;John.Smith@email.io&gt;\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 RStudio’s Build pane \nIf you’re using RStudio, then functioning R packages also have access to the Build pane, which allows us to quickly load, install, and test code. When we open sap, the Build pane is not displayed in the IDE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Build pane is normally between Connections and Git\n\n\nAfter adding the seven mandatory fields to the DESCRIPTION file, devtools::load_all() runs without the previous error, but the IDE still doesn’t display the Build pane:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere is the Build pane?\n\n\n\n3.1.2.1 RStudio projects \n.Rproj files are plain text files with various configurations for the RStudio IDE. We were able to run devtools::load_all() above without the presence of the Build pane because RStudio displays the Build pane after reading the fields in the .Rproj file.\nThe quickest way to access the fields in the .Rproj file is under Tools &gt; Project Options….\n\n\n3.1.2.2 Project options\nSelecting Tools &gt; Project Options… will provide us access to the project-level options. For example, fields 2 - 4 are available under General, 5 - 8 affect the Code options, and the final two fields deal with Sweave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField settings from sap.Rproj file\n\n\nThe default settings were created when we selected the Shiny app project from the New Project Wizard in the last chapter.\n\n\n3.1.2.3 Build tools\nI’ve placed the .Rproj file from sap with the example .Rproj file from R Packages, (2ed) side-by-side so you can compare them below:7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) .Rproj files\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Comparison of sap.Rproj file and .Rproj file in R Packages, 2ed\n\n\n\nI’ve circled the fields in the .Rproj file that illustrate it’s configured to work with an R package. Note that in sap, the Project build tools are initially set to (None) under Build Tools:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) sap.Rproj build tools\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Build tool settings in sap.Rproj file\n\n\n\nChanging the Project build tools option to Package will set the default Build Tools options:8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Default package build tools\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Default build tool settings\n\n\n\nThe links between the Build Tools options and fields in sap.Rproj are in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) sap.Rproj build tool fields\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Default build tool settings in sap.Rproj file\n\n\n\n\nBuildType: Package tells the IDE sap is an R package and triggers the Build pane.\nPackageUseDevtools: Yes links the options in the Build pane to the devtools package.\nThe PackageInstallArgs are complicated, but I’ve included some information about them in the callout block below (and you can read more in the official R documentation)\nThe fourth option (PackageRoxygenize) is available under Generate documentation with Roxygen &gt; Use roxygen to generate:\n\nThese options affect the documentation in an R package. To match the example from R Packages, 2ed above, make sure Rd files, Collate field, and NAMESPACE file are selected and click OK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) PackageRoxygenize in .Rproj file\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: roxygen2 build settings\n\n\n\nAfter clicking OK, the IDE will automatically reboot, and the additional fields will be added to the bottom of the sap.Rproj:\n\n\nLaunch app with the shinypak package:\n\nlaunch('03.2_rproj')\n\n\nVersion: 1.0\n1ProjectId: 1b90afca-cb2f-ae46-4bc8-fc983de5f832\n\nRestoreWorkspace: Default\nSaveWorkspace: Default\nAlwaysSaveHistory: Default\n\nEnableCodeIndexing: Yes\nUseSpacesForTab: Yes\nNumSpacesForTab: 2\nEncoding: UTF-8\n\nRnwWeave: Sweave\nLaTeX: XeLaTeX\n\nBuildType: Package\nPackageUseDevtools: Yes\nPackageInstallArgs: --no-multiarch --with-keep.source\nPackageRoxygenize: rd,collate,namespace\n                                            \n\n\n1\n\nProjectId is a relatively new field, and it helps keep each project configured with the RStudio IDE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is --no-multiarch --with-keep.source?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--no-multiarch: refers to the option for the package installer to only compile the package for the architecture of the current R session. By default, R tries to compile packages for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures if running in a 64-bit R session on Windows. This flag can help avoid problems if a package can only be compiled on one architecture. Read more here.\n--with-keep.source: In R, when a function is created, its body can be stored in two ways: 1) as a parsed but unevaluated expression and 2) as a character string containing the function’s source code. By default, only the parsed expression is kept. If –with-keep.source is specified, R will also keep the source code as a character string, which can be helpful for debugging and tools that analyze or modify source code. Read more here.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the new session starts, the new project-level options activate the Build pane in the IDE, and I can check the R package functionality by loading the code with Build &gt; Load All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentical to running devtools::load_all()\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Positron’s workspaces \nPositron doesn’t recognize RStudio’s project files (.Rproj) or their build tools configuration. Instead, Positron organizes files and paths around workspaces.9\nA workspace is any folder that contains your project’s files. You can open an existing folder or create a new one from Positron’s welcome pane:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3.1 Positron projects\nThe Welcome pane also offers an option for creating a New Project, but this shouldn’t be confused with creating an RStudio project.\nIf we follow the steps for a new project by specifying the type, name, and location:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see this opens a folder in the IDE without an .Rproj file:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re building your Shiny app from scratch, this is still a great way to get started because it makes it easy to adopt best practices (i.e., using Git and renv).\n\n\n3.1.3.2 Build tools\nIn Positron, all of the package development tools from devtools are available, but they are executed and handled a little differently by the IDE. We’ll cover these differences more in the Development, Degbug, and Tests chapters.\n\n\n\n3.1.4 R packages recap\nIn summary, to turn a Shiny Project  into a ‘functioning’ R package that can be installed and loaded into an R session we need:\n\nA DESCRIPTION file containing the seven mandatory fields (Package, Version, License, Description, Title, Author, and Maintainer), making running the necessary devtools functions possible.10\n\n\nIf we’re using RStudio, the .Rproj file must contain the three package configuration fields11, which makes the Build pane accessible and functional.",

    "text": "3.2 App-packages \nShiny app-packages  have all of the functionality of a standard R Package  but also contain the files and folders required to successfully develop, run, and deploy a Shiny app . The Posit documentation lists the following way(s) to create R packages:12\n\n\nCall usethis::create_package().\nIn Posit Workbench, do File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; R Package. This ultimately calls usethis::create_package(), so really there’s just one way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the 03.3_create-package branch of sap.\n\ncreate_package() is a great option if you’re looking for a way to quickly create or convert your Shiny project into a Shiny app-package. In the following sections I’ll cover some suggestions for using create_package().13\n\n3.2.1 New app-packages\nIf you haven’t written any code and want to create a new Shiny app-package, create_package() is the quickest way to get started.\nFirst, install devtools:\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\nlibrary(devtools)\n\ndevtools automatically loads usethis\nLoading required package: usethis\nAssuming your current working directory is where you want your new Shiny app-package, call usethis::create_package() with the path argument set to getwd()\n\nusethis::create_package(path = getwd())\n\nThis call launches a series of actions:\n\nFirst, the active project is set to whatever was given to the path argument.\n✔ Setting active project to 'path/to/newApp'\nThe R/ folder and DESCRIPTION/ file are created:\n✔ Creating 'R/'\n✔ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'\nThe NAMESPACE and .Rproj files are created:\n✔ Writing 'NAMESPACE'\n✔ Writing 'newApp.Rproj'\nThe .Rproj is added to the .Rbuildignore file, the .Rproj.user folder is added to the .gitignore and .Rbuildignore files.\n✔ Adding '^newApp\\\\.Rproj$' to '.Rbuildignore'\n✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'\n✔ Adding '^\\\\.Rproj\\\\.user$' to '.Rbuildignore'\nA new session is opened from the new .Rproj file:\n✔ Opening 'path/to/newApp/' in new RStudio session\n\nWhen the new session opens, newApp has the following contents:\n\nnewApp/\n  ├── .Rbuildignore\n  ├── .Rproj.user/\n  ├── .gitignore\n  ├── DESCRIPTION\n  ├── NAMESPACE\n  ├── R/\n  └── newApp.Rproj\n\nYou’re now free to develop newApp. Store and document any .R files in the R/ folder, edit the DESCRIPTION file with details about the application, read through R Packages and Mastering Shiny, and add the Shiny code to complete your Shiny app-package.\n\n\n3.2.2 Converting a Shiny project\nIf you already have a Shiny app project that needs to be converted into a Shiny app-package, you can also use create_package(path = getwd()) in your root folder, but I recommend using the following arguments:\n\n3.2.2.1 DESCRIPTION arguments\n\nfields: these are arguments passed to usethis::use_description(). If the fields argument is empty, a boilerplate DESCRIPTION file is created (similar to this one).\n\nThese boilerplate fields in the DESCRIPTION work, but I’ve found some of the fields are unnecessary (i.e., I’ve never needed Authors@R: or ORCID) and inevitably require revision, so I’d prefer to handle this during the creation process (and remove the risk of forgetting to change it later).\nAll fields should be passed in a list() as field = 'value' pairs.\n\n\nusethis::use_description(\n    list(Package = 'sap',\n         Version = '0.3.3',\n         Title = 'Shiny App-Packages',\n         Description = 'An R package with a collection of Shiny applications.',\n         \"Authors@R\" = NULL,\n         Author = utils::person(\n            given = \"John\", \n            family = \"Smith\", \n            role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\")),\n          Maintainer = utils::person(\n            given = \"John\", \n            family = \"Smith\",\n            email = \"John.Smith@email.io\"),\n          License = \"GPL-3\"))\n\n\nA few fields require specially formatted values (see the utils::person() examples below).\n\nutils::person(\"John\", \"Smith\", \n              email = \"John.Smith@email.io\", \n              role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"))\n\n[1] \"John Smith &lt;John.Smith@email.io&gt; [aut, cre]\"\n\n\n\nTwo additional arguments from use_description() are passed to create_package():\n\ncheck_name: verifies your Shiny app-package name is valid for CRAN, so we can set this to FALSE (unless you’re planning on submitting to CRAN)\nroxygen2: is TRUE by default and adds the fields required to use roxygen2 (which I won’t cover here because we’ll cover documentation in-depth in a future chapter).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t use \".\" with create_package()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen converting your existing Shiny app project into a Shiny app-package with usethis::create_package(), don’t use '.' in the path argument:\nusethis::create_package('.')\nThis will return the following warning about creating nested projects, and ask if you want to proceed anyway:\nNew project 'sap' is nested inside an existing project\n'./', which is rarely a good idea. If this is unexpected, \nthe here package has a function,\n`here::dr_here()` that reveals why './' is regarded as a\nproject.\n  \nDo you want to create anyway?\n\n1: Yes\n2: No way\n3: Not now\nWe can avoid this warning altogether by passing getwd() to the path argument, so I recommend cancelling the project creation:\nSelection: 2\nError: Cancelling project creation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2.2 IDE arguments\n\nrstudio: adds the necessary Build Tools fields in the .Rproj file (leave as TRUE)\nopen: can be set to FALSE because we don’t need RStudio/Posit Workbench to open in a new session\n\n\nusethis::create_package(\n  path = getwd(),\n  fields = list(Package = 'sap',\n         Version = '0.3.3',\n         Title = 'Shiny App-Packages',\n         Description = 'An R package with a collection of Shiny applications.',\n         \"Authors@R\" = NULL,\n         Author = utils::person(\n            given = \"John\", \n            family = \"Smith\", \n            email = \"John.Smith@email.io\", \n            role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\")),\n          Maintainer = utils::person(\n            given = \"John\", \n            family = \"Smith\",\n            email = \"John.Smith@email.io\"),\n          License = \"GPL-3\"),\n  roxygen = TRUE,\n  check_name = FALSE, \n  rstudio = TRUE,\n  open = FALSE)\n\nAfter running usethis::create_package() with the arguments above, the IDE will present us with a few prompts to confirm:\nOverwrite pre-existing file 'DESCRIPTION'?\nOverwrite pre-existing file 'sap.Rproj'?\nThe Shiny app-package structure is below:\n├── DESCRIPTION\n├── NAMESPACE\n├── R\n│   ├── mod_scatter_display.R\n│   ├── mod_var_input.R\n│   └── utils.R\n├── README.md\n├── app.R\n├── movies.RData\n├── sap.Rproj\n└── www\n    └── Shiny.png\n\n3 directories, 10 files\nThe DESCRIPTION file (shown below) has a few additional fields (Encoding, Roxygen, and RoxygenNote) we didn’t include when we converted sap above, but we will cover these in the upcoming chapters.\nPackage: sap\nTitle: Shiny App-Packages\nVersion: 0.3.3\nAuthor: John Smith [aut, cre]\nMaintainer: John Smith &lt;John.Smith@email.io&gt;\nDescription: An R package with a collection of Shiny applications.\nLicense: GPL-3\nEncoding: UTF-8\nRoxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)\nRoxygenNote: 7.3.2\n\n\nLaunch app with the shinypak package:\n\nlaunch('03.3_create-package')",

Earlier versions of devtools contained most of the functions used for package development. In version 2.0, devtools went under a conscious uncoupling, which means there was a “division of labor” for its core functionality:\nYou don’t have to install all of these packages (they will be loaded with devtools), but the information is essential because it affects the dependencies in your app-package:\nWe will cover this topic more in the dependencies chapter..\nBefore we can start developing, we need to install devtools:\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\nlibrary(devtools)\nusethis is automatically loaded/attached with devtools.\nLet’s assume we’re continuing with a Shiny project from the previous branch of sap.

Placing non-Shiny code in these files isn’t a bad practice–it’s is even encouraged in Mastering Shiny:\n\n“You might want to collect smaller, simpler, functions into one place. I often use R/utils.R for this…”\n\nHowever, because we’ll want to develop tests for scatter_plot(), we should follow the advice in R Packages,2 and rename R/utils.R to R/scatter_plot.R as we transition to an app-package.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR/utils.R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom now on, I’ve renamed R/utils.R to R/scatter_plot.R, so it aligns with the naming conventions in other R packages.\nFor a deep dive on R/utils.R files in R packages, I recommend reading Dissecting R Package “Utility Belts”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Markdown support\nWhen we created our app-package with create_package(), support for markdown formatting in our package help files was automatically included by adding Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE) to the DESCRIPTION file:\n\nPackage: sap\n1Version: 0.0.0.9500\nType: Package\nTitle: Shiny App-Packages\nDescription: An R package with a collection of Shiny applications.\nAuthor: John Smith [aut, cre]\nMaintainer: John Smith &lt;John.Smith@email.io&gt;\nLicense: GPL-3\nRoxygenNote: 7.3.2\nEncoding: UTF-8\n2Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)\n                                                    \n\n\n1\n\nUpdated package version\n\n\n2\n\nMarkdown support\n\n\n\n\nIf this field is not in your DESCRIPTION file, follow the instructions in the roxygen2 documentation for enabling markdown.\n\n\n5.1.3 Title & description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInserting roxygen2 skeletons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio , you can insert an roxygen2 skeleton into your function using Code &gt; Insert Roxygen Skeleton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard roxygen2 skeleton\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first two sections of roxygen2 documentation are the title and description.

These tags should give users an idea of what the function does (you can also use @details)\nArguments (@param) and outputs (@return): List all function arguments with @param. Include the argument type (e.g., integer, character, etc.) and a brief description of what the argument does. Be sure to mention any default or optional arguments. Function outputs should be listed with @return and describe the type or class of the object, whether or not it’s reactive, and mention any related functions.\nExamples: @examples provide executable R code that captures how the function is used in your app-package. These are incredibly valuable for new users trying to understand how a function (and your app-package) works.\n\nApp-package specific considerations:\n\nConnect functions with@seealso and @family: Use @seealso to provide links to related functions (i.e., modules) so users can click through a ‘guided tour’ of your application’s code–group similar functions using @family {description}.\nGive more info with @sections: Use @section to give in-depth explanations and specific details about how a function works, including any information about the @usage or its @params.\n@usage: This field will be automatically generated by roxygen2, but in some circumstances, it makes sense to set it to NULL and describe a function’s use explicitly.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next section, we’ll use roxygen2 to manage our app-package dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee a typo, error, or something missing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease open an issue on GitHub",

    "text": "Managing dependencies\nDependencies are the must-have components for your app-package, and they can be divided into imports and exports.\nIn this chapter we’ll cover how to manage dependencies in your new app-package.\nDependencies are handled with the NAMESPACE (generated via roxygen2 tags) and in the DESCRIPTION file. Together, these files determine which packages and functions our app-package depends on, and the functions and objects we’re making available to anyone using our app-package.\nThis chapter will pick up where we left off with the 05_roxygen2 branch of sap. Below is a folder tree of it’s contents:\nWhen in doubt…load, document, and install\nDuring development, you might lose track of the last devtools function you called (I know I do). If this happens, I’ve found loading, documenting, and installing helps to re-orient me to the current state of the package.\nIt’s also satisfying to see all three functions execute without any errors!\nThe first step in managing dependencies is identifying which packages sap relies on. In the Shiny chapter I introduced the renv package (see Section 2.6.2), which is designed for project-level dependency management. renv ensures the same package versions are used across different systems by capturing R and package versions in a lockfile (renv.lock) and a private library (renv/library).1\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'monospace', \"fontSize\":\"16px\"}}}%%\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph Dir[\"&lt;strong&gt;App-Package Directory&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        Init[\"&lt;code&gt;renv::init()&lt;/code&gt;\"]\n        Snap[\"&lt;code&gt;renv::snapshot()&lt;/code&gt;\"]\n    end\n    subgraph RepEnv[\"&lt;strong&gt;Reproducible Environment&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        Lock[\"&lt;code&gt;renv.lock&lt;/code&gt; file\"]\n        Lib[\"&lt;code&gt;renv/&lt;/code&gt; library\"]\n    end\n    Init --&gt; Snap\n    Snap --&gt;|\"&lt;em&gt;Captures dependencies&lt;br&gt;in lockfile&lt;/em&gt;\"| Lock\n    Snap --&gt;|\"&lt;em&gt;Stores packages&lt;br&gt;in private library&lt;/em&gt;\"| Lib\n\n    style Dir stroke:1px,rx:3,ry:3,font-size:13px\n    style RepEnv stroke:1px,rx:3,ry:3,font-size:13px\n\n\n Project level dependencies with renv\nR packages are designed to distribute and reuse code, so the dependencies are listed in the DESCRIPTION file under Imports, Depends, Suggests, and Remotes. The packages listed in the DESCRIPTION of our app-package will be different than those listed in a renv.lock file because not every package used to create an app-package needs to be used to use and run said app-package.2 However, it’s worth noting that installing an R package doesn’t enforce the strict version control like renv.\nThe diagram below outlines the basic process for importing functions from add-on packages to use in our locally developed package, and then exporting those functions for people to use when they install/load our package.3\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'monospace', \"fontSize\":\"15px\"}}}%%\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph RPkg[\"&lt;strong&gt;R Package (&lt;code&gt;pkg&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        fun(\"Exports &lt;code&gt;fun()&lt;/code&gt; function\")\n    end\n    subgraph SapPkg[\"&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;sap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n    sap(\"Uses &lt;code&gt;pkg::fun()&lt;/code&gt; for local&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;foo()&lt;/code&gt; function\")\n    end\n    Users(\"Users install/load &lt;code&gt;sap&lt;/code&gt; to use &lt;code&gt;foo()&lt;/code&gt;\")\n    RPkg --&gt;|\"&lt;em&gt;imports &lt;code&gt;fun()&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;pkg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;\"| SapPkg\n    SapPkg --&gt;|\"&lt;em&gt;exports &lt;code&gt;foo()&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;sap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;\"| Users\n    \n    style RPkg stroke:1px,rx:3,ry:3,font-size:15px\n    style SapPkg stroke:1px,rx:3,ry:3,font-size:16px\n\n\n Handling package dependencies\nOur goal is to limit the dependencies to only those critical to the functioning of our app, because each additional dependency is a potential point of failure (should this package become unavailable or significantly change).\nA great place to start is our app.R file:\n# pkgs &lt;- c(\"shiny\", \"shinythemes\", \"stringr\", \"ggplot2\", \"rlang\")\n# install.packages(pkgs, quiet = TRUE)\n\n# packages ------------------------------------\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(shinythemes)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(rlang)\n\n# launch_app ------------------------------------\nlaunch_app()\nIdeally, we’ll want to replace these calls to libary(), but first we have to make sure the functions we’re using in these packages will be available in sap.\nWhen we run the contents of app.R, we see the following:\nWhy can’t R find the \"launch_app\" function in app.R?\nLet’s recap what we’ve done so far:\nThe error above is telling us that despite having documentation for launch_app() in the R/ folder and generating the corresponding .Rd file in man/, launch_app() isn’t being exported from sap.",

Let’s check to see if ggplot2 is also attached to the search() list:\n\nc(\"package:ggplot2\") %in% search()\n\n[1] FALSE\nWhy does this matter? Because if these packages aren’t attached to the search() list, we can’t call their functions directly (the way we would if we’d loaded the package with library()). For example, if we try to use ggplot2 to build a plot (similar to the one we have in the app), we see the following:\nggplot(data = mtcars, \n  aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + \n  geom_point()\n# Error in ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) : \n#  could not find function \"ggplot\"\nWe can use the add-on/third-party package functions sap relies on, but we need to explicitly namespace these functions from their original package namespaces (i.e., using pkg::fun()):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2::ggplot(data = mtcars, \n  ggplot2::aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + \n  ggplot2::geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use ggplot2 if we explicitly namespace it’s functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing add-on package functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to add-on/third party functions that are exported from sap?\nWhen a user loads sap with library(sap), any add-on/third-party package functions used in exports are available to users if they use pkg::fun() (or if they load the package themselves with library()).\n\n\n\n\nAccess to add-on/third-party package functions has implications for the other functions in sap–for example, the scatter_plot() function uses ggplot2 functions. But we’re not exporting scatter_plot(), so when we attempt to run the examples, we see the following error:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Error in scatter_plot() examples\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Examples in scatter_plot() function without exporting\n\n\n\nExamples for ‘sap::scatter_plot’\nThe message at the top of the Help pane is informative because it tells us that despite scatter_plot() being functional when we run launch_app(), it’s not part of the package namespace (and thus, not accessible to users in the help file).\n\n\n\nExport scatter_plot()\nLet’s add the @export tag to R/scatter_plot.R so it’s exported from sap.\n\n#' Create scatter plot \n#'\n#' Custom [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) function for building \n#' scatter plots in `sap`.\n#' \n#' \n#' @param df `data.frame` or `tibble`\n#' @param x_var string variable mapped to `x` axis\n#' @param y_var string variable mapped to `y` axis\n#' Generate a Scatter Plot\n#'\n#' Creates a scatter plot using `ggplot2` with the specified data and \n#' aesthetics.\n#'\n#' @param df *(data.frame)* The dataset containing the variables to plot.\n#' @param x_var *(character)* Name of the variable for the x-axis.\n#' @param y_var *(character)* Name of the variable for the y-axis.\n#' @param col_var *(character)* Name of the variable for the color aesthetic.\n#' @param alpha_var *(numeric)* Transparency level of points (0 to 1).\n#' @param size_var *(numeric)* Size of points.\n#'\n#' @return A `ggplot` object representing the scatter plot.\n#'\n#' @section Details:\n#' `scatter_plot()` is designed for use in Shiny applications but can also be \n#'  used independently.\n#' It supports customization of transparency, size, and color aesthetics.\n#'\n#' @seealso\n#' - [`mod_scatter_display_server()`] for integrating this function into the\n#'   scatter plot module.\n#' - [`ggplot2::ggplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for details on \n#'   `ggplot2` usage.\n#'\n#' @family **Utility Functions**\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' scatter_plot(\n#'   df = mtcars,\n#'   x_var = \"mpg\",\n#'   y_var = \"hp\",\n#'   col_var = \"cyl\",\n#'   alpha_var = 0.7,\n#'   size_var = 3\n#' )\n#'\n#' @export\n\nAfter documenting sap, the NAMESPACE is updated with the export() directive:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe contents of the updated NAMESPACE file and typing sap:: in the Console now displays the scatter_plot() help file in the tab completion:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) @export the scatter_plot function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) scatter_plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: scatter_plot() is now part of the sap namespace\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we confirm users can access the help file for scatter_plot() and run the examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning examples in ?scatter_plot\n\n\n\nloadedNamespaces()\nWe’ve already confirmed that ggplot2 isn’t attached with sap (and hence, it is not included in the search() list)\n\nc(\"package:ggplot2\") %in% search()\n\n[1]  FALSE\nHowever, we can access the functions we used the pkg::fun() syntax with because those functions are included in the loaded namespaces (which we can view with loadedNamespaces())\n\nc(\"ggplot2\") %in% loadedNamespaces()\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing non-exported functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about functions that aren’t exported from sap?\nFunctions that are not exported (i.e., do not include the @export tag) are still accessible after installing and loading a package using the pkg:::fun()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to @export\n\n‘Always err on the side of caution, and simplicity.

    "text": "6.2 Package imports\n\n\nLaunch app with the shinypak package:\n\nlaunch('06.2_imports')\n\nImporting dependencies is slightly more involved than exports because imports are managed by both the DESCRIPTION and the NAMESPACE:\n\nThe DESCRIPTION file handles package-level dependencies, specifying which add-on packages our app-package uses.\nThe NAMESPACE manages function-level access, importing functions from add-on packages to be used in our app-package, and–as we’ve seen above–exporting functions from our app-package for others to use.\n\n\nPackage-level depencencies\nThe DESCRIPTION file manages dependencies with three fields: Depends, Imports, and Suggests. Most add-on packages belong under the Imports field (i.e., functions from these packages are used in the code below R/).5\n\nDepends\nPackages listed under Depends are essential for our app-package to work. These packages will be attached before our package when library(sap) is called.\n\n\nImports\nPackages listed under Imports are necessary for our app-package to work. These packages are loaded (but not attached) when our app-package is installed.\n\n\nSuggests\nThe Suggests field should include any packages that enhance our app-package, but aren’t necessary for the basic functionality. This might include packages used in examples, vignettes, tests, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding dependency hell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, you want to keep your app-package lightweight (i.e., limit the number of add-on/third-party dependencies, other than base-R packages and shiny). Doing this ensures you’ll be able to safely use this app-packages as a dependencies in the next app-packages. We’ll cover tracking and exploring dependencies in Chapter 35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction-level access\nFunction-level access is managed using namespace-qualified references (or ‘explicit namespacing’) in the code below R/. The NAMESPACE can also be used to include add-on packages or functions with the @import and @importFrom tags.6\n\nNamespace-qualified referencing: Refer to add-on package functions using pkg::fun() syntax in the code below R/.\nSpecial imports: @importFrom should be used when 1) “You can’t call an operator from another package via ::” 2) “importing a function makes your code much more readable” (not easier to write)\nImporting everything: @import should be used if “you make such heavy use of so many functions from another package that you want to import its entire namespace”\n\n\n\nHandling imports\nThe workflow I use to manage add-on dependencies comes from the advice in the roxygen2 documentation:\n\n“if you are using just a few functions from another package, we recommending adding the package to the Imports: field of the DESCRIPTION file and calling the functions explicitly using ::, e.g., pkg::fun()…”\n…“If the repetition of the package name becomes annoying you can @importFrom and drop the pkg::fun()”. - Importing functions\n\n\nInclude the add-on package to the Imports field with usethis::use_package().\nRefer to add-on functions using explicit namespacing (i.e., pkg::fun()) in the code beneath R/.\n\nWe have some special considerations for the imported add-on functions in our app-package:\n\nUsing @import\nA substantial portion of the code in sap comes from shiny, so we’ll remove the explicit namespacing and place the @import tag in R/launch_app.R7\n\n\nshow/hide R/launch_app.R\n#' Launch the Movies Review Application\n#'\n#' Starts the Movies Review Shiny application, which provides a customizable\n#' scatter plot interface for analyzing movie data.\n#'\n#' @return A **Shiny application** object.\n#'\n#' @section Details:\n#' The application uses:\n#' - **UI**: Defined in [`movies_ui()`].\n#' - **Server Logic**: Defined in [`movies_server()`].\n#'\n#' @seealso\n#' - [`movies_ui()`] for the user interface.\n#' - [`movies_server()`] for the server logic.\n#'\n#' @family **Standalone Application**\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' if (interactive()) {\n#'   launch_app()\n#' }\n#'\n1#' @import shiny\n#' \n\n\n\n1\n\nImport entire shiny package namespace\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing @importFrom\n.data can’t be exported using ::, so we’ll include @importFrom in R/scatter_plot.R.

You can also consolidate all @import and @importFrom tags into a single package doc file (i.e., R/[sap]-package.R) by calling usethis::use_package_doc().\nQuestion 7: Should I be using @importFrom or @import from?\nAnswer 7: prefer @importFrom over @import, but try to avoid using either.13 14\nQuestion 8: Where can I find more information about package namespaces and imports?\nAnswer 8a: Imports are described briefly in R Packages, 2ed15 and covered in-depth in Advanced R, 2ed.16\nAnswer 8b: “Each namespace has an imports environment that can contain bindings to functions used by the package that are defined in another package.”\nAnswer 8c: “The imports environment is controlled by the package developer with the NAMESPACE file. Specifically, directives such as importFrom() and imports() populate this environment.”\nIn order for app-package to work, users needs to have access to any add-on packages that are called in the code below R/. Knowing when, why, how and what happens to imports helps you decide how to fit these habits into your package development workflow.",

Export objects from using @export\nImports: Use pkg::fun() syntax when you use add-on package functions and include them in the Imports field of the DESCRIPTION file. App-packages use so many shiny functions it makes sense to include @import shiny to 1) ensure all of these functions are available, and 2) you won’t need to use pkg::fun().\n\nDESCRIPTION Imports This field lists the packages your app-package uses. All add-on packages used in the R/ folder must be listed in the Imports field. These functions can be called using the pkg::fun() syntax (or with @importFrom()). Functions from these packages will be available for your package, but not for the user unless they use the :: operator or load the package themselves with library().\nNAMESPACE imports: The @import/@importFrom tags make the functions from add-on packages available to your package. Favor using @importFrom over @import for add-on package functions (the only exception being shiny, which you’d want to use @import).\n\n\nThe Imports field in the DESCRIPTION handles package-level dependencies (and it is managed manually or with usethis::use_package()), while the NAMESPACE handles function-level access (with @export and @import/@importFrom). Multiple packages can help you manage the dependencies in your app-package, and these are covered in the Dependency hell chapter.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’d like to read more about package dependencies, I recommend Writing R Extensions (specifically the sections on dependencies 17 and namespaces 18).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee a typo, error, or something missing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease open an issue on GitHub\n\n\n\n\nIn the next section, we’ll cover how to ensure the movies.RData can be stored and loaded in our app-package!",

    "text": "7.1 The data/ folder\nThe previous chapters in this section covered how documenting functions and managing dependencies. In this chapter, we’ll discuss how data files (like movies.RData) become part of an app-package so they can be loaded into our application. We’ll also cover the various locations and purposes for app-package data files.\nData in R packages are typically stored in one of three folders: data/, data-raw/, and inst/extdata/.1 The folder you use will depend on the format, accessibility, and intended purpose of the data file.2\nThe primary location for data is the data/ folder. Objects in data/ folder are available in your package namespace when it’s installed and loaded, and can be accessed with the :: syntax. See the example below of the storms data from dplyr:\nlibrary(dplyr)\nhead(dplyr::storms)\n## # A tibble: 6 × 13\n##   name   year month   day  hour   lat  long status\n##   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; \n## 1 Amy    1975     6    27     0  27.5 -79   tropi…\n## 2 Amy    1975     6    27     6  28.5 -79   tropi…\n## 3 Amy    1975     6    27    12  29.5 -79   tropi…\n## 4 Amy    1975     6    27    18  30.5 -79   tropi…\n## 5 Amy    1975     6    28     0  31.5 -78.8 tropi…\n## 6 Amy    1975     6    28     6  32.4 -78.7 tropi…\n## # ℹ 5 more variables: category &lt;dbl&gt;, wind &lt;int&gt;,\n## #   pressure &lt;int&gt;,\n## #   tropicalstorm_force_diameter &lt;int&gt;,\n## #   hurricane_force_diameter &lt;int&gt;",

    "text": "7.1.1 LazyData\nData files become part of a package when they’re added to the data/ folder and LazyData: true is added to the DESCRIPTION file. Enabling LazyData means the data are only loaded into memory if they are explicitly accessed by the user or a function in the package. Until then, only the dataset name is loaded. This user-friendly practice is the default for most R packages.\nOmitting LazyData (or setting it to false) means we would have to access the data file from the package by explicitly loading it with the data() function.\n\n\n7.1.2 use_data()\nThe usethis::use_data() function simplifies adding data to packages. To use usethis::use_data(), we can load the data into the global environment with load(\"movies.RData\"), then run usethis::use_data(movies):\n\nusethis::use_data(movies)\n\n✔ Adding R to Depends field in DESCRIPTION.\n✔ Creating data/.\n✔ Setting LazyData to \"true\" in DESCRIPTION.\n✔ Saving \"movies\" to \"data/movies.rda\".\n☐ Document your data (see &lt;https://r-pkgs.org/data.html&gt;).\nWe can see use_data() added two fields in the DESCRIPTION and stored movies.rda in the data/ folder. After loading and installing sap, we can see movies is now part the package NAMESPACE.\nIf we run devtools::load_all(), any data in the data/ folder are not lazy-loaded at this stage. However, the data are directly available in our environment for testing during development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we want data to be part of the lazyload DB, we need to install the package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the package is installed, we’ll see the following outputs related to data processing:\n\n** data\n*** moving datasets to lazyload DB\n** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading\n\nmovies is now part of sap’s namespace:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsap::movies\n\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Installed package files\nThe lazyload DB is located in the installed version of the sap package. Installation begins by reading and parsing the DESCRIPTION file to extract metadata such as the package name, version, and dependencies (e.g., Depends, Imports, Suggests). After checking the dependencies (and downloading and installing any that are missing), our source package is extracted, and the files are organized into specific folders:\n\nMeta/: information about datasets, help files, and general package metadata.\nR/: byte-compiled R code stored as .rdb and .rdx files\ndata/: datasets serialized into a lazyload database (stored as .rdb and .rdx files in the R/ directory)\nhelp/: binary help files\nhtml/: html and css files for help files\n\nThe installed folders and files can be viewed using the file path accessor function, system.file().3\n\nsystem.file(..., package = \"\", mustWork = FALSE)\n\nPassing \".\" to the ... argument of system.file() will return the installed location of the root folder of package.\nTo view the path to the R/ folder in our installed package, we can use:\n\nsystem.file(\"R\", package = \"sap\")\n\npath/to/installed/pkg/library/R-4.4/sap/R\nIf we combine this with fs::dir_tree(), we can see the files contained in the R/ folder:\n\nfs::dir_tree(system.file(\"R\", package = \"sap\"))\n\npath/to/installed/pkg/library/R-4.4/sap/R\n├── sap\n├── sap.rdb\n└── sap.rdx\nDuring installation, data in the data/ folder are converted to .rdb and .rdx file formats and moved to the binary database stored in the R/ folder.\n\nfs::dir_tree(system.file(\"data\", package = \"sap\"))\n\npath/to/installed/pkg/library/R-4.4/sap/data\n├── Rdata.rdb\n├── Rdata.rds\n└── Rdata.rdx\nThe lazyload database stores data objects in serialized form for fast retrieval (i.e., data are loaded only when explicitly requested, optimizing memory usage). The diagram below illustrates the development workflow for adding data to an app-package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'monospace', \"fontSize\":\"13px\"}}}%%\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph DESC[\"&lt;strong&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        LazyData(\"Add &lt;code&gt;LazyData: true&lt;/code&gt;\")\n    end\n    subgraph Data[\"&lt;strong&gt;data/ folder&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        app_data[(\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;app_data.rda&lt;/code&gt;\")]\n    end\n    subgraph Global[\"&lt;strong&gt;Global Environment&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        load_data[(\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;app_data&lt;/code&gt;\")]\n    end\n    subgraph Lazy[\"&lt;strong&gt;lazyload DB&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        app_data_lazy[(\"&lt;br&gt;Serialized&lt;br&gt; (&lt;code&gt;.rdb&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;.rds&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;.rdx&lt;/code&gt;)\")]\n    end\n    load(\"&lt;code&gt;devtools::load_all()&lt;/code&gt;\")\n    inst(\"&lt;code&gt;devtools::install()&lt;/code&gt;\")\n    \n    DESC --&gt;|\"&lt;code&gt;usethis::use_data(app_data)&lt;/code&gt;\"|Data\n    Data --&gt; load & inst\n    load --&gt; |\"Direct access for testing\"|Global\n    inst --&gt; |\"Loaded only when&lt;br&gt;explicitly requested\"|Lazy\n  \n\n\n LazyData field in the DESCRIPTION file",

CRAN also has a size limit for packages (if you plan on submitting your app-package).\nFormat: data files in data/ must be either .rda or .RData format.\nDocumentation: document the data files in either a single R/data.R file or individual .R files. Documentation should include the following roxygen2 format:\n#' \n#' @title \n#' \n#' @description\n#' \n#' @format \n#' \\describe{\n#'  \\item{variable}{description}\n#' }\n#'\n'data'\ninst/extdata/: Store external data in the inst/extdata/ directory and access it using system.file(). This can be helpful if your app-package needs access to data files that are not R objects. For faster loading, consider the fst or feather formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee a typo, error, or something missing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease open an issue on GitHub",

Both RStudio  and Positron  offer a single-click button to run our application the top of the Source pane/Editor. We can also launch the app by calling the standalone app function in the Console. Below we’ll cover what happens behind the scenes when we click on these icons.\nIn the current branch of sap, the app.R file contains a call to launch_app(), which loads the package and passes the UI and server functions to shinyApp().\nAs we can see in the image below, this places the Run App icon in RStudio’s  Source pane. In Positron , the app.R file displays the Run Shiny App.\nClicking on either Run App/Run Shiny App buttons calls runApp() and launches our application, but with a loadSupport() warning.\nThe section below will cover the loadSupport() warning and why it appears when using the Run App/Run Shiny App buttons in RStudio  and Positron .",

Specifically, loadSupport()\n\n“loads any top-level supporting .R files in the R/ directory adjacent to the app.R/server.R/ui.R files” 3\n\nBehind the scenes, runApp() is called by both Run App/Run Shiny App buttons, which then automatically calls loadSupport(). This is why if we pass our standalone app function to the Console (which uses shinyApp(), not runApp()), the warning disappears:\n\nRStudio Positron \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo loadSupport() warning in RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo loadSupport() warning in Positron\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe examples above demonstrate the differences between calling shinyApp() and runApp(), and the tension between calling a standalone app function from an R package vs. sourcing the app.R file in a Shiny project.\n\n\n8.1.2 --devmode\nAs we saw above, clicking Run Shiny App in Positron  will launch the application in devmode,4 which is controlled by the script below:\n\n\nshow/hide Positron’s runShinyApp.R script\nusage &lt;- \"Usage: Rscript runShinyApp.R &lt;path&gt; &lt;port&gt; [--devmode]\"\n\n1args &lt;- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)\n\nif (length(args) &lt; 2) {\n  stop(usage)\n}\n\npath &lt;- args[1]\nport &lt;- as.integer(args[2])\nstopifnot(is.integer(port))\n2devmode &lt;- \"--devmode\" %in% args\n\nif (devmode) {\n  shiny::devmode()\n} else {\n  options(shiny.autoreload = TRUE)\n}\n\nmessage(\"Running Shiny app\")\nmessage(\"-----------------\")\nmessage(sprintf('shiny::runApp(%s, port = %d)\\n', deparse(path), port))\n\n3shiny::runApp(path, port = port, launch.browser = FALSE)\n\n\n\n1\n\ncommandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE) retrieves the arguments passed to the script, excluding the default arguments used when R starts.\n\n\n2\n\ndevmode &lt;- \"--devmode\" %in% args checks if the --devmode flag is present among the arguments. If it is, devmode is set to TRUE\n\n\n3\n\nLastly, the script runs the Shiny app using runApp() (with the specified path and port), and launch.browser = FALSE ensures the app is not automatically opened in a web browser.\n\n\n\n\nShiny devmode will display something like the following messages the first time your application is launched using the Run Shiny App button in Positron :\n\n\nshow/hide devmode options\nshiny devmode - Using full shiny javascript file.

    "text": "8.2 Shiny launch functions\n\nIn the following sections, we’ll compare shinyApp(), shinyAppDir(), and runApp() to determine which one to use in R/launch_app.R and the app.R file. As we’ve seen, the Run App/Run Shiny App buttons call runApp(), even when we have a call to shinyApp() in the app.R file. This might make you wonder,\n“Why even include a call to shinyApp() if the app is being launched with runApp()?”\nLet’s review what happens when we call shinyApp().\n\n8.2.1 shinyApp()\nOne of the key features of shinyApp() is the creation of the shiny.appobj (a shiny app object):\n\napp &lt;- shinyApp(ui = movies_ui, \n                server = movies_server)\nstr(app)\n\nIf we look at the structure of the returned object from shinyApp(), we see the shiny.appobj includes the appDir under appOptions:\nList of 5\n $ httpHandler     :function (req)  \n $ serverFuncSource:function ()  \n $ onStart         : NULL\n $ options         : list()\n $ appOptions      :List of 2\n1  ..$ appDir       : chr \"/path/to/sap\"\n  ..$ bookmarkStore: NULL\n2 - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"shiny.appobj\"\n\n1\n\nappDir is the first argument of runApp()\n\n\n2\n\nA shiny app object\n\n\nThis is why runApp() works with any .R file creating a shiny app object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshinyApp()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshinyApp(): Creates and launches an app defined inline within the call itself (or with UI and server functions passed as arguments).\n\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui = fluidPage(\n    # UI elements\n  ),\n  server = function(input, output) {\n    # Server logic\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 shinyAppDir()\nshinyAppDir() is similar to shinyApp(), but is designed to use a “path to directory that contains a Shiny app.”\nIn practice, we can use shinyAppDir() with a returned object from shinyApp():\n\napp &lt;- shinyApp(\n        ui = movies_ui,\n        server = movies_server\n      )\napp$appOptions$appDir\n\n[1] \"path/to/sap\"\nThis path can be passed to the appDir argument (along with any Shiny options).\n\nshinyAppDir(\n  appDir = app$appOptions$appDir,\n  options(test.mode = TRUE)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshinyAppDir()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshinyAppDir(): Launches an app from a directory (with an app.R or ui.R/server.R files).\n\n\nshinyAppDir(\n  appDir = \"path/to/app/\", \n  options = list())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3 runApp()\nThe reason we’re able to call runApp() in the Console to launch both applications above is because it’s very versatile:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrunApp()\nCan launch apps from ui.R/server.R, app.R or directory:\n\n\n\n# In console\nrunApp()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks with a path to an .R file that creates a shiny.appobj:5\n\n\nrunApp(appDir = \"path/to/sap\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan also use a shiny.appobj directly:\n\n\napp &lt;- shinyApp(\n        ui = movies_ui,\n        server = movies_server)\nrunApp(appDir = app)\n\n\n\nThis final method does not produce the loadSupport() warning because a Shiny object (shiny.appobj) has already been created, and runApp() is essentially calling print(app) in the Console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrunApp()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrunApp(): A generalized way to launch your app–it can run apps defined inline, or from a directory.\n\n\nrunApp(\n  appDir = \"path/to/app/\",\n  test.mode = TRUE/FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecap\n\nshinyApp() is typically used to create apps within an interactive R session\nshinyAppDir() runs a Shiny app stored in a directory (containing an app.R file (or ui.R and server.R files)\nrunApp() also launches apps in a directory, but it’s versatility makes it suitable for running apps in various formats, either defined inline or in separate directories.6",

The sink() function “diverts R output to a connection”, so the code below sends the output that would normally print to the console to the where error messages are written.\n\nif (!interactive()) {\n   sink(stderr(), type = \"output\")\n} else {\n   \n}\n\nThis is useful in a non-interactive settings if we want to re-direct the error output for the console text-mode connection.\ntryCatch() is used for ‘catching conditions’ during the execution of an expression (expr =):\n\nif (!interactive()) {\n   sink(stderr(), type = \"output\")\n   tryCatch(expr = {\n      library(sap)\n   }, error = function(e) {\n      pkgload::load_all()\n   })\n} else {\n   \n}\n\nIn this case, if library(sap) throws an error, the function specified after error = is executed (i.e., pkgload::load_all()).8\nWritten this way, in a non-interactive R session, app.R will re-direct the error output and attempt to load and attach sap, and if this fails, app.R will attempt to load all the files in the R/ folder.\n\n\n8.4.1.2 Interactive sessions\nIf the session is interactive, we want app.R to load all the code in the R/ folder with pkgload::load_all() before launching our app with launch_app() (and a few optional arguments).\n\nif (!interactive()) {\n  sink(stderr(), type = \"output\")\n  tryCatch(\n    expr = {\n      library(sap)\n    },\n    error = function(e) {\n      pkgload::load_all()\n    }\n  )\n} else {\n  pkgload::load_all()\n}\n  sap::launch_app(\n    options = list(test.mode = TRUE), run = 'p')\n\npkgload::load_all() is the function that’s called when we run devtools::load_all() (or use Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + L), and this is somewhat analogous to running library(sap)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew dependency!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pkgload package is imported as part the devtools/usethis workflow, otherwise we’d want to add it the Imports field of the DESCRIPTION with usethis::use_package('pkgload').\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.1.3 Dealing with loadSupport()\nThe withr package is designed to ‘run code with safely and temporarily modified global state’, and it comes in handy when launching shiny apps. For example, I want to turn off the loadSupport() behavior when launching the app from app.R.9\nWe can use withr::with_options() to accomplish this using the following new and code arguments\n\nnew: a named list of the new options and their values\n\ncode: the ’Code to execute in the temporary environment\n\nWe’ll place the withr::with_options() at the top of app.R and pass shiny.autoload.r = FALSE to the new argument (the contents of our app.R are passed into the code argument).\n\n1withr::with_options(new = list(shiny.autoload.r = FALSE), code = {\n2  if (!interactive()) {\n    sink(stderr(), type = \"output\")\n    tryCatch(\n      expr = {\n        library(sap)\n      },\n      error = function(e) {\n        pkgload::load_all()\n      }\n    )\n3  } else {\n    pkgload::load_all()\n  }\n4    sap::launch_app(\n      options = list(test.mode = TRUE), run = 'p')\n}) \n\n\n1\n\nTurn off loadSupport()\n\n\n2\n\nDefine non-interactive behaviors\n\n\n3\n\nDefine interactive behaviors\n\n\n4\n\nLaunch app (with options)\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve updated the app.R to account for the app-package structure, we’ll load, document, and install sap and send it’s contents to the Console:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + L\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + D\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew dependency!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe withr package is imported as part the devtools/usethis workflow, otherwise we’d want to add it the Imports field of the DESCRIPTION with usethis::use_package('withr').\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Updated app.R\nWhen we send the contents of app.R to the Console, the loadSupport() options are applied before running the app:\n\nRStudio Positron \n\n\n\n\n\nSending app.R to RStudio’s Console\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSending app.R to Positron’s Console\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR/_disable_autoload.R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the documentation for loadSupport(), you’ll find a second option for removing the R/ directory sourcing behavior: placing a _disable_autoload.R file in the R/ directory (this is also one of the behaviors of the golem framework, which we will cover in the following chapters).\nBoth methods work–this chapter demonstrates a way to remove the loadSupport() warning without having to add this file.",

We went over what to include in the standalone app function and the app.R file, the differences between shinyApp(), shinyAppDir() and runApp(), but it’s worth exploring these topics further (especially if you plan on having more than one apps in your package).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecap: launching your app\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshinyApp():\n\nshinyApp() doesn’t care about file structure, so it’s useful for quick prototyping or if the app is in a single .R script. It’s also more portable because you can share your app with a single .R script.\n\nIt’s possible to bundle shinyApp() in a wrapper function to integrate within an R package (like we’ve done with launch_app()).\nshinyApp() returns a shiny app object, which can be useful if you want to explore the app structure programmatically (i.e., testing).\n\n\nshinyAppDir():\n\nshinyAppDir() launches an app from a directory, and is useful if an app is spread across multiple files and folders.\n\nrunApp()\n\nrunApp() a more generalized way to launch an app. It works with:\n\napps contained in a directory (i.e., runApp('path/to/app')\napps in separate ui.R and server.R files (or a single app.R file)\na shiny app object (passed to the appDir argument).\n\nClicking on Run App will run the application with runApp() if is detects a file (or files) that creates a shiny object.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following chapter, we’re going to cover where to put non-standard R package files that are common to Shiny apps (images, .css/.scss file, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee a typo, error, or something missing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease open an issue on GitHub",

We can use system.file() and fs::dir_tree() to print a folder tree of our installed package files:\nVery few of the source folders and files we’ve been working with remain in the installed version of our package.

We can use the image files in inst/quarto/www by adding a call to addResourcePath() in the setup chunk:\n\n```{r}\n1#| context: setup\n2library(sap)\nlibrary(thematic)\nlibrary(ragg)\n3addResourcePath(\n    prefix = 'quarto',\n    directoryPath = system.file('www', package = 'sap'))\n4options(shiny.useragg = TRUE)\n5thematic::thematic_set_theme(\n  theme = thematic::thematic_theme(\n    bg = \"#070d35\", \n    fg = \"#FFFFFF\", \n    sequential = NA, \n    accent = \"#2ee3a4\"))\n```\n\n1\n\nsetup for HTML document\n\n2\n\npackages (including our app-package)\n\n3\n\nresources (including CSS)\n\n4\n\noptions (for images)\n\n5\n\ntheme from thematic\n\n\n\nNote the context: setup chunk includes options and themes (I’m using the thematic package to set a theme for the ggplot2 graph in our app).\nUsing page-layout: full in the YAML header lets us use a variety of panel options for each code chunk. For example, we’ll place the variable input module in a code chunk with the input option,11 the display module with the center option,12 and the data/Quarto attribution in the fill option.13\n\n```{r}\n1#| panel: input\nmod_var_input_ui(\"vars\")\n```\n\n```{r}\n2#| panel: center\nmod_scatter_display_ui(\"plot\")\n```\n\n```{r}\n3#| panel: fill\ntags$br()\ntags$em(\n  \"Built using \",\n  tags$a(\n    img(\n      src = \"www/quarto.png\",\n      height = 25,\n      width = 90,\n      style = \"margin:10px 10px\"\n    ),\n    href = \"https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/shiny/\"\n  ),\n  \"and data from the \",\n  tags$a(\"Building web applications with Shiny\", \n    href = \"https://rstudio-education.github.io/shiny-course/\"),\n  \"tutorial.\"\n)\n```\n\n1\n\nHorizontal input panel\n\n\n2\n\nCenter the graph display\n\n\n3\n\nData/Quarto attribute with hyperlinks across bottom of app\n\n\n\nThe context: setup and panel option code chunks will execute when the document is rendered.

    "text": "Shiny bugs\nExpand the callout boxes below to review what we’ve covered in the last section:\nThis section covers common methods for debugging R code and how we can adapt these methods to use within a Shiny app. So far this book has covered the contents of an R package containing a basic, functioning Shiny app. But as apps grow in complexity, it’s highly likely you’ll encounter bugs or errors during development.1\nFortunately, both RStudio  and Positron  come with powerful interactive debuggers, which help us identify, analyze, and fix errors in our code. Consider the diagram below that illustrates the reactive inputs in our application:\nThe inputs are collected by the variable input module2 and passed to the graph display module (as var_inputs()),3 where they become the reactive inputs() for the graph utility function,4 before finally being rendered.\nOur application launches with pre-selected values for the x, y and color graph inputs, along with values for the size and opacity (alpha) of the points. Users can add a title or change the graph inputs, but by having pre-selected values, we guarantee the graph renders when the application launches.\nAny text entered for the title is converted to title case when the variable inputs are passed to the scatter plot display module. The reactives in the application are all updated with the new output:\nIn Shiny apps, debugging can be challenging because the reactive model involves dynamic interactions and a non-linear flow of execution between inputs, reactive expressions, and outputs. Shiny is inherently asynchronous, so bugs can originate from reactive dependencies, execution order, utility functions, hidden states, lazy evaluation, and invalidation (i.e., reactive(), observe(), isolate(), etc.).\nFor example, we could have an incorrectly defined inputIds or outputIds in the UI, which causes our graph utility function to fail. We could also have missing parentheses on reactive values in the server. Finally, the bug could be originating from the output/render point.\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'monospace', \"fontSize\":\"16px\"}}}%%\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph Inputs[\"&lt;strong&gt;Inputs&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        subgraph Variables[\"Variables\"]\n        var_input[/\"&lt;code&gt;input$x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;input$y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;input$z&lt;/code&gt;\"/]\n        end\n        subgraph Aesthetics[\"Aesthetics\"]\n        aes_input[/\"&lt;code&gt;input$alpha&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;input$size&lt;/code&gt;\"/]\n        end\n        subgraph Title[\"Title\"]\n        plot_title[/\"&lt;code&gt;input$plot_title&lt;/code&gt;\"/]\n        end\n    end\n    IDs(\"🪲 &lt;code&gt;inputId&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;outputId&lt;/code&gt; errors 🪲\") --x var_input & aes_input & plot_title\n    subgraph React[\"&lt;strong&gt;App Reactives&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        var_inputs&gt;\"&lt;code&gt;var_inputs()&lt;/code&gt; \"]\n        inputs&gt;\"&lt;code&gt;inputs()&lt;/code&gt;\"]\n    end\n    Obs(\"🪲 &lt;code&gt;observe&lt;/code&gt; listener&lt;br&gt;errors 🪲\") --x React\n    Rxt(\"🪲 Reactive context&lt;br&gt;errors 🪲\") --x Inputs & React\n    subgraph Output[\"&lt;strong&gt;Output&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        output[\\\"&lt;code&gt;output$scatterplot&lt;/code&gt;\"\\]\n    end\n    Rend(\"🪲 &lt;code&gt;render_*&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;br&gt;errors 🪲\") ----x Output\n\n    var_input & aes_input &lt;==&gt; var_inputs \n    plot_title &lt;-.-&gt; var_inputs \n    var_inputs &lt;==&gt; inputs\n    inputs &lt;==&gt; output\n    \n    style var_input stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,rx:5,ry:5 \n    style aes_input stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,rx:5,ry:5\n    style IDs stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,rx:10,ry:10\n    style Obs stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,rx:10,ry:10\n    style Rend stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,rx:10,ry:10\n    style Rxt stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,rx:10,ry:10\n\n\n Possible locations of bugs in a reactive model\nUnderstanding the interplay of reactivity, lazy evaluation, and asynchronous execution will help us diagnose and resolve bugs in our Shiny app. We have to employ specific strategies and tools to handle Shiny bugs effectively, and some of the traditional debugging approaches can fall short in reactive contexts.",

We’ll close the observe() scope after the reactive inputs() are created:\n\n\nshow/hide debugging functions in the module server function\ndev_mod_scatter_server &lt;- function(id, var_inputs) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n1    observe({\n2      browser()\n      \n3      all_data &lt;- fst::read_fst(\"tidy_movies.fst\")\n\n4      graph_data &lt;- reactive({\n        if (input$missing) {\n          tidyr::drop_na(data = all_data)\n        } else {\n          all_data\n        }\n      }) |&gt;\n        bindEvent(input$missing)\n\n5      inputs &lt;- reactive({\n        plot_title &lt;- tools::toTitleCase(var_inputs()$plot_title)\n        list(\n          x = var_inputs()$x,\n          y = var_inputs()$y,\n          z = var_inputs()$z,\n          alpha = var_inputs()$alpha,\n          size = var_inputs()$size,\n          plot_title = plot_title\n        )\n      })\n    })\n    \n6    observe({\n      output$scatterplot &lt;- renderPlot({\n        plot &lt;- sap::scatter_plot(\n          df = graph_data(),\n          x_var = inputs()$x,\n          y_var = inputs()$y,\n          col_var = inputs()$z,\n          alpha_var = inputs()$alpha,\n          size_var = inputs()$size\n        )\n        plot +\n          ggplot2::labs(\n            title = inputs()$plot_title,\n            x = stringr::str_replace_all(\n              tools::toTitleCase(inputs()$x), \"_\", \" \"),\n            y = stringr::str_replace_all(\n              tools::toTitleCase(inputs()$y), \"_\", \" \")\n          ) +\n          ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n          ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n      })\n    }) |&gt;\n      bindEvent(graph_data(), inputs())\n    \n  })\n}\n\n\n\n1\n\nObserver scope\n\n\n2\n\nCall to browser() (execution paused)\n\n3\n\nRead tidy_movies.fst data\n\n\n4\n\nMissing data checkbox logic\n\n\n5\n\nReactive values from user inputs\n\n6\n\nModule graph code (outside of observe() scope)\n\n\n\n\nThen we’ll load the changes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd launch the app using:\n\nlaunch_app(app = \"ggp2\")\n\n\n\nLaunch app with the shinypak package:\n\nlaunch('10_debugger')\n\nAs noted above, browser() pauses code execution and activates the interactive debugger mode, allowing us to view objects, execute code, and ‘step through’ the function line-by-line.\n\n10.2.1 IDE Changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Positron Version\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of this writing, the 2025.01.0-39 pre-release of Positron was available for testing.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the app is launched, Positron  alerts us that we’re in debugging mode by making a few changes to the IDE:3\n\nSidebar\n\nThe Run and Debug sidebar menu item is displayed and the footer is highlighted in blue4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositron IDE in debugger mode (click to enlarge)\n\n\n\n\nEditor\nThe dev_mod_scatter.R file in the Editor highlights the browser() function in yellow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugger in file Editor (click to enlarge)\n\n\n\n\nConsole\nThe Console tells us browser() was ‘Called from: observe()’ and displays the interactive debugger prompt:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugger in file Editor (click to enlarge)\n\n\nobserve() does not inherently pause or interrupt other reactive processes—it just triggers when changes occur within its scope. So when we’re using observe() for debugging, we need to define the context (or scope) for its behavior.\nThe output in the Console tells us the tidy_movies.fst data are downloaded, but our placement suspends the execution of the application before these data are loaded and the graph is rendered in the UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugger in Console (click to enlarge)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuspended ggplot2movies data app (click to enlarge)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive debugger can only access variables and values inside the observe() scope, but this process can be incredibly useful for addressing bugs (and for exploring how an application works). In the next sections, we’ll ‘step through’ the module function to explore how the missing values are removed from the graph.\n\n\n\n10.2.2 Variables and values\nWe want to use the interactive debugger to proceed through the module function until the data object enters the logic for the missing checkbox, and then we can confirm its structure.\n\n\nStep through/execute each line of code by entering n in the Console.\n\nBrowse[1]&gt; n\n\nAs we ‘step through’ the function, Positron’s  Console displays the debug at location, followed by the code line number:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull path and line number to the file containing our call to browser() (click to enlarge)\n\n\nIn the Editor, the same line of code is highlighted in yellow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorresponding line number in Editor (click to enlarge)\n\n\nThe line creating graph_data gives us a hint for how the missing data are removed (i.e., with bindEvent()), but we’ll explore this more in Print debugging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph_data() reactive creation (click to enlarge)\n\n\nUnder Locals in the DEBUG VARIABLES sidebar, we can see all_data is listed as a &lt;data.frame&gt;, and graph_data are listed as a &lt;reactive.event&gt;:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge DEBUG VARIABLES in sidebar\n\n\nIn the next section, we’ll explore these variables (and the reactive inputs).\n\n\n10.2.3 Inspecting variables\nWe can use the Console to evaluate code while the interactive debugger is running. This comes in handy if we want to check the structure of an object inside a module (like all_data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse[1]&gt; str(all_data)\n\n\n'data.frame':   58788 obs. of  10 variables:\n$ title      : chr  \"$\" \"$1000 a Touchdown\" ...\n$ year       : int  1971 1939 1941 1996 1975 ...\n$ length     : int  121 71 7 70 71 91 93 25 97 ...\n$ budget     : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n$ rating     : num  6.4 6 8.2 8.2 3.4 4.3 5.3 ...\n$ votes      : int  348 20 5 6 17 45 200 24 18 51 ...\n$ mpaa       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"G\",\"PG\",\"PG-13\" ...\n$ genre_count: int  2 1 2 1 0 1 2 2 1 0 ...\n$ genres     : chr  \"Comedy, Drama\" \"Comedy\" ...\n$ genre      : Factor w/ 8 levels \"Action\": 6 3 6 ...\n\n\n\nThis gives us an idea of the total rows before missing are removed.\n\n\n10.2.4 Inspecting values\nThe reactive values and inputs can also be viewed in the Console, and we can see graph_data() is ‘bound’ to input$missing with bindEvent(). We can confirm the input$missing value in the Console:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse[1]&gt; input$missing\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nThis tells us the ‘Remove missing’ checkbox has been selected, and we can verify the missing values have been removed from graph_data():\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse[1]&gt; identical(\n              nrow(tidyr::drop_na(all_data)), \n              nrow(graph_data())\n            )\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nUsing browser() to ‘step through’ an application gives us a better understanding of the ‘order of execution’, and it lets us see how input$missing and bindEvent() work together to remove the missing values with the checkbox.",

In this chapter, we’ll explore another commonly used technique for identifying and resolving issues or errors: print debugging.\nPrint debugging uses a simpler approach than the interactive debugger, and it’s well-suited for a variety of development workflows. Print debugging involves inserting a print() (or cat()) statement into the body of a function to output variables, values, or other important information at various points.\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'monospace', \"fontSize\":\"14px\"}}}%%\nflowchart LR\n    Insert([\"Insert call&lt;br&gt;to &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"])\n    Print(\"Encounter&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat()&lt;/code&gt;\")\n    Insert --&gt; Exec\n    Exec(\"Execute&lt;br&gt;function\") --&gt; Print(\"Encounter&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt;\")  \n    Print --&gt; Issue{{\"&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Output&lt;br&gt;reveals&lt;br&gt;issue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\"}}\n    Issue -- \"Yes\" --&gt; Mod([\"Modify&lt;br&gt;function\"])\n    Issue -- \"No\" --&gt; Insert\n\n\n Print debugging with print() function calls",

When placed in the app server function, the function will return the inputs from both modules.\nBelow is an example of using reactiveValuesToList() inside the our app server function:\n\nmovies_server &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n      output$vals &lt;- renderPrint({\n        app_vals &lt;- reactiveValuesToList(x = input, all.names = TRUE)\n        str(app_vals)\n      })\n      \n      selected_vars &lt;- mod_var_input_server(\"vars\")\n\n      mod_scatter_display_server(\"plot\", var_inputs = selected_vars)\n      \n}\n\nWe’ll also add the following to the bslib = TRUE section of movies_ui() to print the output of the reactive list to the UI:\n\nmovies_ui &lt;- function(bslib = FALSE) {\n  addResourcePath(\n    prefix = 'www',\n    directoryPath = system.file('www/', package = 'sap'))\n  if (isFALSE(bslib)) {\n    tagList(\n        bslib::page_fillable(\n          h1(\"Movie Reviews\"),\n          bslib::layout_sidebar(\n            sidebar =\n              bslib::sidebar(\n                title = tags$h4(\"Sidebar inputs\"),\n                img(\n                  src = \"www/shiny.png\",\n                  height = 60,\n                  width = 55,\n                  style = \"margin:10px 10px\"\n                ),\n                mod_var_input_ui(\"vars\")\n              ),\n            bslib::card(\n              full_screen = TRUE,\n              bslib::card_header(\n                tags$h4(\"Scatter Plot\")\n              ),\n              bslib::card_body(fillable = TRUE,\n                mod_scatter_display_ui(\"plot\")\n              ),\n              bslib::card_footer(\n                tags$blockquote(\n                  tags$em(\n                    tags$p(\n                      \"The data for this application comes from the \",\n                      tags$a(\"Building web applications with Shiny\",\n                        href = \"https://rstudio-education.github.io/shiny-course/\"\n                      ),\n                      \"tutorial\"\n                    )\n                  )\n                )\n              )\n            )\n          )\n        )\n      )\n  } else {\n    tagList(\n      bslib::page_fillable(\n        title = \"Movie Reviews (bslib)\",\n        theme = bslib::bs_theme(\n          bg = \"#101010\",\n          fg = \"#F6F5F5\",\n          primary = \"#EE6F57\",\n          secondary = \"#32E0C4\",\n          success = \"#FF4B5C\",\n          base_font = sass::font_google(\"Ubuntu\"),\n          heading_font = sass::font_google(\"Ubuntu\")\n        ),\n        bslib::layout_sidebar(\n          sidebar = bslib::sidebar(\n            mod_var_input_ui(\"vars\")\n          ),\n          bslib::card(\n            full_screen = TRUE,\n                bslib::card_header(\n                  tags$img(\n                  src = \"www/bootstrap.png\",\n                  height = 80,\n                  width = 100,\n                  style = \"margin:10px 10px\"\n                )\n              ),\n             bslib::card_body(\n1              verbatimTextOutput(outputId = \"vals\"),\n              mod_scatter_display_ui(\"plot\")\n            )\n          )\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  }\n} \n\n\n1\n\nPrinted reactive value outputs\n\n\n\n\nAfter loading the changes to our package, we can view the application with the captured and printed reactive values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\n\nNote the difference between the two printed values: the output in the sidebar has been printed from within the module server function, so the input names are contained within that namespace (i.e., x, y, etc.). However, the list returned from reactiveValuesToList() has been placed in the app server function, so we can see the module id appended to the input name (i.e., vars-y, vars-x, etc.).",

We only can see what we explicitly print, and if we miss a key variable or condition, we have to to insert, remove, or adjust print functions, which can be time-consuming. Excessive print functions can also clutter the code and output especially in large or complex application.",

    "text": "13.1 Why Use Logging?\nA proactive method for debugging Shiny applications is implementing logging. Logs are essential for debugging, auditing, and monitoring, particularly in Shiny app development and R packages. This chapter discusses integrating logging into a Shiny app-package to improve debugging and issue-tracking efficiency.\nLogging enables us to monitor application flow and user interactions while identifying runtime errors and unexpected behaviors. It offers more structure and flexibility than print statements or interactive debuggers. Logs are particularly beneficial in production environments where direct debugging isn’t possible. Logs can also be saved for future analysis even after the application has stopped.",

Below I’ll briefly cover Shiny’s validate() function to check if input values or conditions are valid before executing server code and tryCatch() for handling unexpected runtime errors.\n\n\n13.1.2 Validating inputs\nvalidate() can be used to prevent unexpected errors by preventing the execution of subsequent code if the validation conditions fail.\n\nInside validate(), we can use need() to check if a condition is met\n\ntry() will catch any errors that occur if the inputs are NULL or missing.\n\nIf an error occurs, try() prevents the application from crashing and instead returns an error message:\n\n\n\nvalidate(\n  need(\n    try(some code),\n    \"Error message\"\n  )\n)\nBelow are example of validate(), try() and need() for the alpha and size inputs:\n\ninput$alpha\n\nvalidate(\n  need(\n    try(input$alpha &gt;= 0 & input$alpha &lt;= 1),\n    \"Alpha must be between 0 and 1\"\n  )\n)\n\nValues and behaviors:\n\n\n\ninput$alpha\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\n0.5 (valid)\n✅ Passes validation\n\n\n1.5 (invalid)\n❌ Error: \"Alpha must be between 0 and 1\"\n\n\nNULL\n❌ Error: \"Alpha must be between 0 and 1\"\n\n\nNA\n❌ Error: \"Alpha must be between 0 and 1\"\n\n\n\"high\" (string)\n❌ Error: \"Alpha must be between 0 and 1\"\n\n\n\n\n\ninput$size\n\nvalidate(\n  need(\n    try(input$size &gt; 0),\n    \"Size must be positive\"\n  )\n)\n\nValues and behaviors:\n\n\n\ninput$size\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\n3 (valid)\n✅ Passes validation\n\n\n-2 (invalid)\n❌ Error: \"Size must be positive\"\n\n\nNULL\n❌ Error: \"Size must be positive\"\n\n\nNA\n❌ Error: \"Size must be positive\"\n\n\n\"large\" (string)\n❌ Error: \"Size must be positive\"\n\n\n\nvalidate(), need() and try() can prevent unnecessary computations when an input is missing or incorrect, and they provide a user-friendly message instead of a cryptic error.\n\n\n\n13.1.3 Handling errors\nThe base R tryCatch function can also be used to log unexpected errors gracefully. What does gracefully mean? In this case, it means we can decide what we want to do if a particular function fails. Below is an example of using it with reactive() and combining it message():\n\nsafe_reactive &lt;- reactive({\n    tryCatch({\n        # Code that might throw an error\n        \n    }, error = function(e) {\n        message(paste0(\"An error occurred:\", e$message))\n    })\n})\n\ntryCatch() will catch unpredictable errors (e.g., missing file, incorrect format) and prevent our entire Shiny app from stopping due to a single point of failure.\nCombining Shiny’s validation functions with tryCatch() ensures both expected and unexpected issues are managed effectively, making our apps more resilient, user-friendly, and stable.",

    "text": "13.2 Base R logging\nCustom logging functions can be written entirely using base R (i.e., without adding any dependencies to our app-package).

For example, dev_mod_scatter_server() creates the graph_data() reactive based on the missing data checkbox user input:\n\ngraph_data &lt;- reactive({\n  if (input$missing) {\n    graph_data &lt;- tidyr::drop_na(data = all_data)\n  } else {\n    graph_data &lt;- all_data\n  }\n}) |&gt;\n  bindEvent(input$missing)\n\nWe’ll add validate() and tryCatch() with a log_message() to log if 1) graph_data() contains all of the observations or the missing values have been removed, and 2) if the reactive was created successfully.\n\ngraph_data &lt;- reactive({\n  \n1  validate(\n    need(try(is.logical(input$missing)), \n          \"Missing must be logical\")\n  )\n  \n    tryCatch({\n      if (input$missing) {\n        \n2        log_message(message = \"Removing missing values.\",\n                    log_file = \"_logs/ggp2_log.txt\", save = TRUE)\n        graph_data &lt;- tidyr::drop_na(data = all_data)\n        \n      } else {\n        \n3        log_message(message = \"Using all data.\",\n                    log_file = \"_logs/ggp2_log.txt\", save = TRUE)\n        graph_data &lt;- all_data\n        \n      }\n      \n      graph_data\n      \n    }, error = function(e) {\n      \n4      log_message(message = sprintf(\"Error processing graph data: %s\", e$message),\n        log_file = \"_logs/ggp2_log.txt\", save = TRUE)\n5      NULL\n      \n    })\n}) |&gt; \n  bindEvent(input$missing)\n\n\n1\n\nValidation for missing checkbox input\n\n\n2\n\nConfirm missing values and create graph_data\n\n\n3\n\nUse all data and create graph_data\n\n\n4\n\nPrint and log message is error occurs\n\n5\n\nReturn null value for error\n\n\n\n\nThese logs will tell us the application loaded the .fst data and removed the missing values, but we should also check what happens when we change something, so we’ll adapt the code used to create our inputs() reactive with the log_message() function:\n\ninputs &lt;- reactive({\n\n  tryCatch({\n    plot_title &lt;- tools::toTitleCase(aes_inputs()$plot_title)\n    \n1    if (nchar(plot_title) &gt; 0) {\n      log_message(\n        sprintf(\"Processing plot title: '%s'\", plot_title), \n        log_file = \"_logs/ggp2_log.txt\")\n    }\n    \n      input_list &lt;- list(\n        x = var_inputs()$x,\n        y = var_inputs()$y,\n        z = var_inputs()$z,\n        alpha = aes_inputs()$alpha,\n        size = aes_inputs()$size,\n        plot_title = plot_title\n      )\n    \n2    log_message(\n      sprintf(\"Inputs: %s\", \n              paste(\n                names(input_list), input_list, sep = \" = \", collapse = \", \")\n              ),\n            log_file = \"_logs/ggp2_log.txt\", save = TRUE)\n    \n    input_list\n  }, error = function(e) {\n    \n3    log_message(\n      sprintf(\"Error in processing inputs: %s\", conditionMessage(e)),\n      log_file = \"_logs/ggp2_log.txt\", save = TRUE)\n    \n4    NULL\n  })\n})\n\n\n1\n\nLog the plot title.\n\n\n2\n\nLog the final input list.\n\n\n3\n\nLog the error if anything goes wrong.\n\n\n4\n\nReturn NULL on error to prevent breaking downstream dependencies.\n\n\n\n\nAfter loading and installing sap, we launch the inst/tidy-movies app again, but this time we un-check the remove missing checkbox and add a new plot title before stopping the application.\n\nlaunch_app(\"ggp2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog messages from inputs()\n\n\nTo view the log file, we need to use system.file() (we’re launching the app from the installed location, not the version we’re developing in the inst/tidy-movies/ folder). I’ve added readLines() and writeLines() so it prints nicely to the Console:\n\nsystem.file('tidy-movies', '_logs', 'ggp2_log.txt', \n            package = 'sap') |&gt; \n            readLines() |&gt; \n            writeLines()\n\n[2025-01-29 11:34:40] Loading fst data \n[2025-01-29 11:34:40] Removing missing values. \n[2025-01-29 11:34:40] Inputs: x = year, y = budget, z = mpaa, alpha = 0.5, size = 2, plot_title =  \n[2025-01-29 11:35:46] Loading fst data \n[2025-01-29 11:35:46] Removing missing values. \n[2025-01-29 11:35:46] Inputs: x = year, y = budget, z = mpaa, alpha = 0.5, size = 2, plot_title =  \n[2025-01-29 11:35:52] Loading fst data \n[2025-01-29 11:35:52] Removing missing values. \n[2025-01-29 11:35:52] Inputs: x = year, y = budget, z = mpaa, alpha = 0.5, size = 2, plot_title =  \n[2025-01-29 11:35:57] Inputs: x = year, y = budget, z = mpaa, alpha = 0.5, size = 2, plot_title = Title \nIn practice, we’d insert logging messages with log_message() and tryCatch() for application startup, loading data/connecting to databases, API calls, and when using Shiny’s internal validation/error handling functions. In the next section, we’re going to explore using add-on packages to implement logging in our app-package.",

    "section": "13.3 Logging with logger",
    "text": "13.3 Logging with logger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogging frameworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R ecosystem offers several libraries for logging.\nThe most popular options are:\n\nfutile.logger: A lightweight and flexible logging package.\nlogger: A modern, extensible, and user-friendly library.\nlog4r: Inspired by the Java log4j library, suitable for structured logging.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section will focus on the logger package because it is simple, easy to integrate with Shiny, and extensible.\n\ninstall.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"daroczig/logger\")\n\nAdd logger to the package dependencies in the DESCRIPTION file and use the logger::fun() syntax to avoid adding @import or @importFrom roxygen tags.\n\nusethis::use_package('logger')\n\n\n13.3.1 Log levels\nThe logger package has a few configurations that can be very helpful for app-package development. We’ll start with a basic example using logger::log_info():\n\nname &lt;- \"world\"\nlogger::log_info('Hello, {name}')\n\nINFO [2025-01-22 11:07:52] Hello, world\nThe output is a nicely formatted log message, and by default logger supports glue syntax. However, the following function (logger::log_debug()) doesn’t return a log message to the Console:\n\nlogger::log_debug('Hello, {name}')\n\nThis is because the logger package has a threshold configuration that controls the ‘verbosity’ of the logs printed to the Console. If we check the log_threshold(), we see it’s set to INFO:\n\nlogger::log_threshold()\n\nLog level: INFO\nIf we reset the logger::log_threshold() to DEBUG, we will see the call in the Console.\n\nlogger::log_threshold('DEBUG')\nlogger::log_debug('Hello, {name}')\n\nDEBUG [2025-01-22 11:08:36] Hello, world\nWe can set the log threshold dynamically to control the verbosity of logs:\n\nlogger::log_threshold('TRACE') # fine-grained, verbose logging for development\nlogger::log_threshold('DEBUG') # verbose logging for development\nlogger::log_threshold('WARN')  # only warnings and errors for production\n\nWhile developing app-packages, I recommend broadly characterizing the logger log levels into the following categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment\nDescriptive messages for easier debugging\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nTRACE\nFine-grained tracking for debugging flows (e.g., reactive updates, function calls).\n\n\nDEBUG\nDiagnostic information for inputs, intermediate states, and outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction\nLower verbosity levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nINFO\nSession-level events and significant actions (e.g., app startup, data loading).\n\n\nWARN\nSuspicious but non-fatal conditions (e.g., unusual input values or data sizes).\n\n\nERROR\nHandled errors with appropriate messaging and graceful recovery.\n\n\nFATAL\nCritical failures leading to app crashes or irrecoverable states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.2 Storing log files\nBy default, logger logs are written to the console, but the logger::appender_file() function can direct log messages to a file (or to a database or external logging system).1\nWe also want to periodically archive old logs to prevent storage issues. Storing log messages as JSON objects is sometimes preferred because JSON files are structured, machine-readable, and can easily integrate with logging tools like Logstash, Kibana (ELK Stack) or other log management solutions.\n\n\n13.3.3 Custom logger functions\nWe’ll write a custom logging function with logger to so our app logs are formatted and managed a consistent manner. Below is a logr_msg() utility function for inserting logger-style logs in our application.\n\nlogr_msg &lt;- function(message, level = \"INFO\", log_file = NULL, json = FALSE) {\n  \n1  logger::log_appender(appender = logger::appender_console)\n  \n  if (!is.null(log_file)) {\n2    if (json) {\n      logger::log_layout(layout = logger::layout_json())\n3    } else {\n      logger::log_appender(appender = logger::appender_tee(log_file))\n    }\n  }\n  \n4  logger::log_formatter(formatter = logger::formatter_glue)\n  \n5  switch(\n    level,\n    \"FATAL\" = logger::log_fatal(\"{message}\"),\n    \"ERROR\" = logger::log_error(\"{message}\"),\n    \"WARN\" = logger::log_warn(\"{message}\"),\n    \"SUCCESS\" = logger::log_success(\"{message}\"),\n    \"INFO\" = logger::log_info(\"{message}\"),\n    \"DEBUG\" = logger::log_debug(\"{message}\"),\n    \"TRACE\" = logger::log_trace(\"{message}\"),\n6    logger::log_info(\"{message}\")\n  )\n}\n\n\n1\n\nAll logs print to console\n\n2\n\nWrite logs to JSON if the json = TRUE\n\n\n3\n\nDefault appender_tee for plain text logs\n\n\n4\n\nSet the default formatter\n\n\n5\n\nHandle all log levels\n\n\n6\n\nDefault to INFO\n\n\n\n\nlog_appender controls where the log messages go. It specifies the “destination” for each log message, whether that’s the Console, a file, or both.\nlog_formatter is like a template for log messages–it determines how log each message is structured and displayed. We can control what information is included in each message (like the timestamp, log level, and the actual message), and how this information is formatted. Predefined formatters (like formatter_glue) uses glue syntax to create flexible and readable formats.\nWe’ll demonstrate logr_msg() with the mod_var_input_server() function, which returns the variable inputs from the UI. The message in logr_msg() is built with glue::glue() and includes the three reactive inputs from this module. We’re also appending the log output to a new log file (_logs/app_log.txt).\n\nmod_var_input_server &lt;- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    \n1    logr_msg(\"mod_var_input_server started\",\n      level = \"TRACE\", log_file = \"_logs/app_log.txt\")\n    \n    observe({\n2        logr_msg(\n          glue::glue(\"Reactive inputs: \n                      x = {input$x}, y = {input$y}, z = {input$z}\"),\n          level = \"DEBUG\", log_file = \"_logs/app_log.txt\")\n    }) |&gt; \n      bindEvent(c(input$x, input$y, input$z))\n\n    return(\n      reactive({\n3        logr_msg(\n          glue::glue(\"Reactive inputs returned: \n                      x = {input$x}, y = {input$y}, z = {input$z}\"),\n          level = \"DEBUG\", log_file = \"_logs/app_log.txt\")\n        list(\n          \"x\" = input$x,\n          \"y\" = input$y,\n          \"z\" = input$z\n        )\n      })\n    )\n  })\n}\n\n\n1\n\nTRACE log for starting the module\n\n\n2\n\nDEBUG log for collecting inputs\n\n3\n\nDEBUG log for returning inputs\n\n\n\n\nAn advantage to using the logger package is that our log messages are automatically printed to the Console while the application is launched, although when we load and install sap and launch the inst/tidy-movies app, we don’t see any logs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + L\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + D\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlaunch_app(\"ggp2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial messages from logr_msg()\n\n\nTo view the log in our app, we need to set the log threshold:\n\nlogger::log_threshold('TRACE')\nlaunch_app(\"ggp2\")\n\nThe logs are now printed to the console and we can see the level, timestamp, and message:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdates from logr_msg()",

Avoid including a startup message if the app-package if the message doesn’t add meaningful value and becomes unnecessary “noise” for users.\nAlso, be sure to allow users to disable the message if possible (e.g., using suppressPackageStartupMessages()):\n\ninstall.packages('pak')\npak::pak('mjfrigaard/sap')\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(sap))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitialize logging with .onLoad()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can set up logger’s logging configuration in an onLoad function of the zzz.R file:\n.onLoad &lt;- function(libname, pkgname) {\n    # configure logger log messages to console\n    logger::log_appender(logger::appender_console)\n    # configure logger log messages to file\n    logger::log_appender(logger::appender_file('sap_apps.log'))\n    # set default log level to DEBUG\n    logger::log_threshold('DEBUG') \n}\nThis setup ensures that logging is ready as soon as your package is loaded.",

Excellent resources exist for writing unit tests 1 and testing shiny apps.2 The goal of this chapter is to illustrate the connections between the user’s needs, the code below R/, and developing tests.3\nInformation about the various tasks and activities an application is expected to perform in typically stored in some kind of software requirements specification (SRS) document.4 The SRS can include things like distinct design characteristics, budgetary, technological, or timeline restrictions, etc. This document breaks down an application’s intended purpose (i.e., the problem it’s designed to solve) into three general areas: user specifications, features, and functional requirements.",

    "text": "15.2 Application developemnt\nThe Shiny application development process follows something like the figure below:\n\n\n\nGeneral application development process\n\n\nThe figure above is an oversimplification, but it highlights a common separation (or ‘hand-off’) between users/stakeholders and developers. In the sections below, we’ll look at two common development processes: test-driven and behavior-driven development.\n\nTest-driven development\nIf sap was built using test-driven development (TDD), the process might look something like this:\n\nGather user needs and translate into application features:\n\nDocument the application’s capabilities for exploring movie review variables from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes.\nInclude feature descriptions for displaying continuous variables (i.e., ‘critics score’ and ‘audience score’) categorical variables (i.e., ‘MPAA’ ), graph visual attributes (size, color, opacity), and an optional plot title.\n\nWrite Tests:\n\nWrite tests to ensure the graph displays relationships between a set of continuous and categorical variables when the app launches.\n\nRun Tests:\n\nBefore writing any code, these tests will fail.\n\nDevelop Features:\n\nWrite UI, server, module, and utility functions for user inputs and graph outputs.\n\nRerun Tests:\n\nIf the graph has been correctly implemented in the application, the tests should pass.\n\nWrite more Tests:\n\nAdd more tests for additional functionalities (e.g., an option to remove missing values from graph).\n\n\nStarting with tests and writing just enough code to get them to pass often results in developing less (but better) code. The drawback to this approach is a strict focus on the function being tested and not the overall objective of the application.\n\n\nBehavior-driven development\nIn behavior-driven development (BDD) (or behavior-driven testing), users and developers work together to understand, define and express application behaviors in non-technical language, 7\n\n“Using conversation and examples to specify how you expect a system to behave is a core part of BDD” - BDD in Action, 2ed\n\nPlacing an emphasis on writing human-readable expectations for the application’s behaviors makes it easier to develop tests that can focus on verifying each user need exists (and is functioning properly). In BDD, the application’s expected capabilities are captured in Features and illustrated with concrete examples, or Scenarios.\n\nFeatures\nIn BDD, a Feature describes an implemented behavior or capability in the application, from a user’s perspective. Typically, these are written in the Gherkin format using specific keywords:8\n\nAs a ...\n\nI want ...\n\nSo that ...\n\nBelow is an example Gherkin Feature for the graph in launch_app():\nFeature: Visualization\n    As a user\n    I want to see the changes in the plot\n    So that I can visualize the impact of my customizations\nAs you can see, the feature uses plain language and the wording is user-centric, so it remains accessible to both developers and users (or other non-technical stakeholders).\n\n\nScenarios\nA Gherkin Scenario provides a concrete example of how the Feature works and has the following general format:\n\nGiven ...\n\nWhen ...\n\nThen ...\n\nAn example Scenario for launch_app() might be:\n  Scenario: Viewing the Data Visualization\n    Given I have launched the application\n    And it contains movie review data from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes\n    And the data contains variables like 'Critics Score' and 'MPAA'\n    When I interact with the controls in the sidebar panel\n    Then the graph should update with the selected options\n\n\nBackgrounds\nInstead of repeating any pre-conditions in each Scenario (i.e., the steps contained in the “Given” and first “And” statement), we can establish the context with a Background:\n  Background: Launching the application\n    Given I have launched the application\n    And it loads with movie review data from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes\n    \n  Scenario: Viewing the Data Visualization\n    Given the data contains variables like 'Critics Score' and 'MPAA'\n    When I interact with the controls in the sidebar panel\n    Then the graph should update with the selected options\nAdopting the Gherkin format (or something similar) provides a common language to express an application’s behavior:\n\nAs developers, we can work with users and shareholders to write specifications that describe the expected behavior of each Feature\nWhen developing tests, we can group the tests by their Feature and Scenarios\nEach test can execute a step (i.e., the Then statements).\n\nIn the next section we’ll cover how to map test code for each Scenario step with testthat.",

    "text": "Launch app with the shinypak package:\n\nlaunch('16.1_test-help')\n\n\n“The ensurer is familiar with testthat 3e as well as tidy style, and incorporates context from the rest of your R package to write concise and relevant tests.” - ensure documentation\n\n\n\n16.1.1 Help, not automation\nThe ensure package does a great job when writing basic unit tests, but as you’ll see, it doesn’t have a solid understanding of the specification or functional requirements of your application (only you know these). The test code created by ensure often needs some editing.\nFor example, the following test code was created for R/scatter_plot.R function:\n\ntest_that(\"scatter_plot creates a ggplot object\", {\n  \n  p &lt;- scatter_plot(mtcars, \"mpg\", \"hp\", \"cyl\", 0.7, 3)\n  \n  expect_s3_class(p, \"gg\")\n  expect_equal(ggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$x.range,\n    range(mtcars$mpg))\n  expect_equal(ggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$y.range,\n    range(mtcars$hp))\n})\n\ntest_that(\"scatter_plot handles different alpha and size values\", {\n  \n  p1 &lt;- scatter_plot(mtcars, \"mpg\", \"hp\", \"cyl\", 0.5, 2)\n  p2 &lt;- scatter_plot(mtcars, \"mpg\", \"hp\", \"cyl\", 1, 4)\n  \n  expect_true(p1$layers[[1]]$aes_params$alpha &lt; p2$layers[[1]]$aes_params$alpha)\n  expect_true(p1$layers[[1]]$aes_params$size &lt; p2$layers[[1]]$aes_params$size)\n})\n\nBased on the descriptions, these would test two important functional requirements of our application. However, two of these tests fail:\n[ FAIL 2 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 3 ]\n\n── Failure (test-scatter_plot.R:6:3): scatter_plot creates a ggplot object ─────\nggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$x.range (`actual`) not equal to range(mtcars$mpg) (`expected`).\n\n`actual` is NULL\n`expected` is a double vector (10.4, 33.9)\n\n── Failure (test-scatter_plot.R:8:3): scatter_plot creates a ggplot object ─────\nggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$y.range (`actual`) not equal to range(mtcars$hp) (`expected`).\n\n`actual` is NULL\n`expected` is a double vector (52, 335)\n[ FAIL 2 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 3 ]\nThis might lead us to believe our utility function is not behaving as expected. But when we dig into the method and values these tests are using, we discover it’s an issue with the test:\n\n# build plot\np &lt;- scatter_plot(mtcars, \"mpg\", \"hp\", \"cyl\", 0.7, 3)\n# check x \nggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$x.range\n\nNULL\n\n# check y \nggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$y.range\n\nNULL\nThe correct code for these tests would be the panel_params (not panel_ranges), but these aren’t going to work either, because ggplot2 automatically adjusts the axis limits based on the data and potential aesthetic mappings (which we can confirm with waldo::compare()):2\n\nwaldo::compare(\n  x = ggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_params[[1]]$x.range, \n  y = range(mtcars$mpg))\n\n`old`:  9.2 35.1\n`new`: 10.4 33.9\n\nwaldo::compare(\n  x = ggplot2::ggplot_build(p)$layout$panel_params[[1]]$y.range, \n  y = range(mtcars$hp))\n\n`old`: 37.9 349.1\n`new`: 52.0 335.0\nWe can continue trying to find something produced by ggplot2::ggplot_build(), but this test confirms the “scatter_plot creates a ggplot object”, so why not just use ggplot2::is_ggplot():\n\ntest_that(\"scatter_plot creates a ggplot object\", {\n  p &lt;- scatter_plot(mtcars, \"mpg\", \"hp\", \"cyl\", 0.7, 3)\n  expect_true(ggplot2::is_ggplot(p))\n})\ntest_that(\"scatter_plot handles different alpha and size values\", {\n  p1 &lt;- scatter_plot(mtcars, \"mpg\", \"hp\", \"cyl\", 0.5, 2)\n  p2 &lt;- scatter_plot(mtcars, \"mpg\", \"hp\", \"cyl\", 1, 4)\n  expect_true(p1$layers[[1]]$aes_params$alpha &lt; p2$layers[[1]]$aes_params$alpha)\n  expect_true(p1$layers[[1]]$aes_params$size &lt; p2$layers[[1]]$aes_params$size)\n})\n\n[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 3 ]\nI’ve provided this example because it illustrates some important limitations when using ensure (or any LLMs) to help write code: Don’t confuse volume with precision. LLMs are great at generating copius amounts of code, but have no way of checking if the code is functional or accurate. In this case, it arguably would’ve taken less time to do the research and write the correct test (instead of debugging the one created by ensure).\nIt’s also worth pointing out that if the original test code did pass, the test_that() description wouldn’t the expectation (these belong in a “scatter_plot x and y limits match true range of values” test).\n\n\n16.1.2 Test scope\nOne of the recent updates to the testthat package (version 3.2.0) emphasizes limiting code that exists outside of our tests.3\n\n“Eliminating (or at least minimizing) top-level code outside of test_that() will have the beneficial effect of making your tests more hermetic. This is basically the testing analogue of the general programming advice that it’s wise to avoid unstructured sharing of state.” - Self-sufficient tests, R Packages, 2ed\n\nStrategies for reducing or removing the code outside of test_that() tests include:4\n\n\nMove file-scope logic to either narrower scope (just this test) or a broader scope (all files).\nIt’s ok to copy and paste: test code doesn’t have to be super DRY. Obvious &gt;&gt;&gt; DRY\n\n\nCode outside of test_that() usually serves a specific purpose (load or manipulate data, set options, create folders or files, etc). The section below describes methods for including these behaviors in tests without placing code outside the test scope.\n\n\n16.1.3 Test fixtures\n\nTest fixtures can be anything used to create repeatable test conditions (data, file paths, functions, etc.). Good test fixtures provide a consistent, well-defined test environment, and then are removed/destroyed when the test is executed. This ensures any changes made during the test don’t persist or interfere with future tests.5\nIn R packages, test fixtures are stored in the tests/testthat/fixtures/ folder:6\n\ntests/\n├── testthat/\n│   └── fixtures/                                         \n└── testthat.R",

Including testing functions in the R/ folder also ensures they’re documented (and any dependencies become part of your app-package).10\n\n16.3.1 Test helpers\n\n\n“Helper files are a mighty weapon in the battle to eliminate code floating around at the top-level of test files.” Testthat helper files, R Packages, 2ed\n\nTest helpers reduce repeated/duplicated test code. In general, objects or values that aren’t large enough to justify storing as static test fixtures can be created with helper functions. Helper functions are stored in tests/testthat/helper.R, which is automatically loaded with devtools::load_all():\n\ntests/\n  ├── testthat/\n1  │   ├── fixtures/\n  │   │   ├── make-tidy_ggp2_movies.R\n  │   │   └── tidy_ggp2_movies.rds\n2  │   ├── helper.R\n3  │   └── test-scatter_plot.R\n  └── testthat.R\n\n\n1\n\nTest fixture scripts and .rds files\n\n\n2\n\nHelper functions\n\n\n3\n\nTest file\n\n\n\n\nTest helpers should only be created if they make testing easier when the tests fail. The article, ‘Why Good Developers Write Bad Unit Tests’, provides great advice on complexity vs. clarity when writing unit tests,\n\n‘think about what will make the problem obvious when a test fails. Refactoring may reduce duplication, but it also increases complexity and potentially obscures information when things break.’\n\nR programmers resist copy + paste programming, and in most cases this makes sense. After all, R is a functional programming language, so it’s tempting to bundle any repeated code into a function and store it in the tests/testthat/helper.R file.\nHowever, when we’re writing tests, it’s more important that tests are easy to read and understand when they fail.\nFor example, consider the ggp2_scatter_inputs inputs passed to the scatter_plot() function in the previous test:\n\nggp2_scatter_inputs &lt;- list(  \n        x = \"rating\",\n        y = \"length\",\n        z = \"mpaa\",\n        alpha = 0.75,\n        size = 3,\n        plot_title = \"Enter plot title\"\n)            \n\nWe could write a var_inputs() function that stores these values in a list. In our tests, this would allow us to use var_inputs() with the same ‘reactive syntax’ we use with scatter_plot() in the module server function:\n\nvar_inputs &lt;- function() {\n   list(x = \"rating\",\n        y = \"length\",\n        z = \"mpaa\",\n        alpha = 0.75,\n        size = 3,\n        plot_title = \"Enter plot title\")\n}\nvar_inputs()\n## $x\n## [1] \"rating\"\n## \n## $y\n## [1] \"length\"\n## \n## $z\n## [1] \"mpaa\"\n## \n## $alpha\n## [1] 0.75\n## \n## $size\n## [1] 3\n## \n## $plot_title\n## [1] \"Enter plot title\"\n\nWhile this removes duplicated code, it also makes it less clear for the reader what var_inputs() contains and where it was created (without opening the helper.R file).\n\n1tidy_ggp2_movies &lt;- readRDS(test_path(\"fixtures\",\n                                \"tidy_ggp2_movies.rds\"))\n  \napp_graph &lt;- scatter_plot(\n  tidy_ggp2_movies,\n2  x_var = var_inputs()$x,\n  y_var = var_inputs()$y,\n  col_var = var_inputs()$z,\n  alpha_var = var_inputs()$alpha,\n  size_var = var_inputs()$size)\n\ntestthat::expect_true(ggplot2::is_ggplot(app_graph))\n\n\n1\n\nLoad test fixture\n\n\n2\n\nIdentical to the code in mod_scatter_display_server()\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, the make_ggp2_inputs() function below creates inputs for the scatter_plot() utility function:\n\nmake_ggp2_inputs &lt;- function() {\n  glue::glue_collapse(\"list(x = 'rating',\n     y = 'length',\n     z = 'mpaa',\n     alpha = 0.75,\n     size = 3,\n     plot_title = 'Enter plot title'\n     )\"\n  )\n}\n\nI can call make_ggp2_inputs() in the Console and it will return the list of values to paste into each test:\n\nmake_ggp2_inputs()\n## list(x = 'rating',\n##      y = 'length',\n##      z = 'mpaa',\n##      alpha = 0.75,\n##      size = 3,\n##      plot_title = 'Enter plot title'\n##      )\n\nWhile copying and pasting this list into the test doesn’t reduce the number of keystrokes per test, it also doesn’t obscure the source of the values in the test (like with var_inputs()).\nglue::glue_collapse() is your friend when you want to quickly reproduce code for your tests. make_var_inputs() creates the list of inputs for testing the original movies data:\n\nmake_var_inputs &lt;- function() {\n  glue::glue_collapse(\"list(y = 'audience_score', \n     x = 'imdb_rating',\n     z = 'mpaa_rating',\n     alpha = 0.5,\n     size = 2,\n     plot_title = 'Enter plot title'\n    )\")\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolating the DRY principle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have repeated code in your tests, consider the following questions below before creating a helper function:\n\nDoes the code help explain what behavior is being tested?\nWould a helper make it harder to debug the test when it fails?\n\nIt’s more important that test code is obvious than DRY, because it’s more likely you’ll be dealing with this test when it fails (and you’re not likely to remember why all the top-level code is there).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.3.2 Test development\nWhile developing, using keyboard shortcuts makes it easier to iterate between building fixtures, writing and running tests, and checking code coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevtools:::test_coverage_active_file()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest coverage on active file\n\n\nWe can see the test coverage on the scatter_plot() function is 100%, but this only covers a small percentage of the code in our app-package.\n\ndevtools:::test_coverage()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest coverage on sap package",

Let’s briefly recep what we’ve learned:\n\nTest Help: ensure provides LLMs help for getting a solid ‘first draft’ of your unit tests. I’ve found it’s helpful to have an expectation (i.e., the expected argument of expect_equal()) before generating tests, as this makes it easier to review the test code (and make sure they’re testing what matters).\nTest Fixtures: We’ve seen how test fixtures are reliable for setting up a consistent testing environment. Using fixtures to load test data ensures that each test runs under uniform conditions. This approach enhances our tests’ reliability and simplifies the testing process by abstracting standard setup and teardown tasks.\n\nFixtures prepare the test environment and the initial state. The tidy_ggp2_movies.rds data is a test fixture, and it creates the tidy_ggp2_movies data within the test scope.\n\nTest Helpers: Helpers allow us to encapsulate repetitive tasks or setup configurations, making our tests cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain. Whether it’s a custom function to create mock Shiny sessions or a utility for simulating user input, helpers streamline the testing workflow significantly.\n\nIf find yourself writing small, reusable pieces of code to perform specific tasks inside your tests, consider converting them into a function in tests/testthat/helper.R.\n\nTest Snapshots: Snapshot testing introduces the tests/testthat/_snaps folder for capturing and comparing the Shiny application state over time. Snapshot testing helps ensure that changes to the application do not unintentionally alter its behavior or appearance, and snapshot files allow us to quickly identify and address regressions by automatically detecting differences between the expected and actual snapshots.\n\nTest complex outputs using snapshots, but cautiously. Snapshots are susceptibile to failure with small (sometimes inconsequential) changes, which produce false negatives test failures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee a typo, error, or something missing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease open an issue on GitHub",

    "text": "17.1 Integration tests\nIn the previous chapters we covered using fixtures and helpers to our test suite. In this chapter, we’re going briefly discuss some tips for testing modules with Shiny’s testServer() function–specifically, how to verify modules are collecting and returning values correctly.\nIntegration tests verify that functions and components work together, and often involves instantiating multiple objects to interact with each other in a single test. In Shiny apps, integration tests typically involve using testServer() function to test reactive interactions between modules.\nFor example, to confirm that the UI module functions are working (i.e., that user-inputs are updating in the application), we need to test the following changes:\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'monospace', \"fontSize\":\"13px\"}}}%%\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph Inputs[\"Inputs\"]\n        subgraph Variables[\"mod_var_input\"]\n        var_input[/\"&lt;code&gt;input$x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;input$y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;input$z&lt;/code&gt;\"/]\n        end\n        subgraph Aesthetics[\"mod_aes_input\"]\n        aes_input[/\"&lt;code&gt;input$alpha&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;input$size&lt;/code&gt;\"/]\n        plot_title[/\"&lt;code&gt;input$plot_title&lt;/code&gt;\"/]\n        end\n        \n    end\n    subgraph React[\"Server\"]\n        subgraph Display[\"mod_scatter_display\"]\n        var_inputs&gt;\"&lt;code&gt;var_inputs&lt;/code&gt; \"]\n        aes_inputs&gt;\"&lt;code&gt;aes_inputs&lt;/code&gt; \"]\n        inputs&gt;\"&lt;code&gt;inputs()&lt;/code&gt;\"]\n        end\n    end\n    subgraph Output[\"Output\"]\n        output[\\\"output$scatterplot\"\\]\n    end\n\n    var_input &lt;--&gt; |\"Pre-selected&lt;br&gt;values\"|var_inputs \n    aes_input &lt;--&gt; |\"Pre-selected&lt;br&gt;values\"|aes_inputs \n    plot_title -.-&gt; |\"User&lt;br&gt;input\"|aes_inputs \n    var_inputs & aes_inputs &lt;--&gt; |\"Assembled into..\"|inputs\n    inputs &lt;--&gt; |\"Rendered as...\"|output\n    \n    style var_input stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,rx:5,ry:5 \n    style aes_input stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,rx:5,ry:5\n    \n\n\n Module communication between UI and server",

We covered using browser() and the interactive debugger in the Debuggers chapter. browser() is a powerful tool for interactive debugging during development, and tests ensure long-term stability and reliability. I recommend using both in tandem, because the interactive debugger can help us understand reactivity, and then we can write tests to prevent bugs and errors and confirm fixes.\nFor example, if we pause execution with the interactive debugger in movies_server(), we can see the difference between calling selected_vars and selected_vars():\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nselected_vars vs. selected_vars()\n\n\nWhen we pass selected_vars and selected_aes to the var_inputs and aes_inputs arguments, we’re not passing the returned values (this is why we don’t need the parentheses).\n\nmod_scatter_display_server(\"plot\", \n                          var_inputs = selected_vars, \n                          aes_inputs = selected_aes)\n\nWithout the parentheses, we’re calling on the method (or function) created by the call to reactive() (inside mod_var_input_server()).3\n\nBrowse[1]&gt; selected_vars\n\nreactive({\n    logr_msg(glue::glue(\"Reactive inputs returned: x = {input$x}, y = {input$y}, z = {input$z}\"), \n        level = \"DEBUG\")\n    list(x = input$x, y = input$y, z = input$z)\n}) \nViewing selected_vars() in the interactive debugger with the parentheses, we see the actual values from the mod_var_input module:\n\nBrowse[1]&gt; selected_vars()\n\n$x\n[1] \"imdb_rating\"\n\n$y\n[1] \"audience_score\"\n\n$z\n[1] \"mpaa_rating\"\nThis distinction is important because we need to know what to pass into the var_inputs and aes_inputs arguments when we test the mod_scatter_display_server() function.\nWe’ll start by writing the feature and scenario for this functionality using testthat’s BDD functions below:\n\ndescribe(\n  \"Feature: Scatter Plot Configuration in Movie Review Application\n      As a user \n      I want the initial graph pre-configured with variables and aesthetics,\n      So that I can immediately see a meaningful visualization.\",\n  code = {\n    it(\n      \"Scenario: Scatter plot initial x, y, color values \n         Given the movie review application is loaded\n         When I view the initial scatter plot\n         Then the scatter plot should show 'IMDB Rating' on the x-axis\n         And the scatter plot should show 'Audience Score' on the y-axis\n         And the points on the scatter plot should be colored by 'MPAA Rating'\n         And the size of the points should be set to '2'\n         And the opacity of the points should be set to '0.5'\n         And the plot title should be 'New Plot Title'\",\n      code = {\n        \n        # testServer() code\n        \n      })\n  })\n\nWe’re going to break the contents of testServer() down sequentially based on what we saw in the interactive debugger and the functionality of mod_scatter_display_server. We know we’re testing a module function that collects the reactive values, so we need to wrap those values in reactive() in the args() argument: 4\n\nshiny::testServer(\n  app = mod_scatter_display_server,\n  args = list(\n1    var_inputs =\n3      reactive(\n        list( \n            x = \"critics_score\",\n            y = \"imdb_rating\",\n            z = \"mpaa_rating\"\n          )\n        ),\n\n2      aes_inputs =\n4        reactive(\n          list( \n            alpha = 0.5,\n            size = 2,\n            plot_title = \"enter plot title\"\n            )\n          )\n\n  ),\n  expr = {\n\n})\n\n\n1\n\nvar_inputs argument in mod_scatter_display_server\n\n2\n\naes_inputs argument in mod_scatter_display_server\n\n3\n\nList of reactive variable inputs\n\n\n4\n\nList of reactive aesthetic inputs\n\n\n\n\nWe know that inside mod_scatter_display_server, the values collected from var_inputs and aes_inputs are assembled into a single inputs() reactive. We also know the plot title will be converted to title case before it’s rendered in the UI, so we need to account for this in the expected values.\n\nshiny::testServer(\n  app = mod_scatter_display_server,\n  args = list(\n1    var_inputs =\n3      reactive(\n        list( \n            x = \"critics_score\",\n            y = \"imdb_rating\",\n            z = \"mpaa_rating\"\n          )\n        ),\n\n2      aes_inputs =\n4        reactive(\n          list( \n            alpha = 0.5,\n            size = 2,\n            plot_title = \"enter plot title\"\n            )\n          )\n\n  ),\n  expr = {\n    test_logger(start = \"COLLECT\", msg = \"collected module values\")\n    expect_equal(\n5      object = inputs(),\n      expected = list(\n        x = \"critics_score\",\n        y = \"imdb_rating\",\n        z = \"mpaa_rating\",\n        alpha = 0.5,\n        size = 2,\n6        plot_title = \"Enter Plot Title\"\n      )\n    )\n    test_logger(end = \"COLLECT\", msg = \"collected module values\")\n})\n\n\n1\n\nvar_inputs argument in mod_scatter_display_server\n\n2\n\naes_inputs argument in mod_scatter_display_server\n\n3\n\nList of reactive variable inputs\n\n\n4\n\nList of reactive aesthetic inputs\n\n5\n\nCompare inputs() to initial values\n\n\n6\n\nTitle case plot title\n\n\n\n\nThe test_logger() can tell us when the expr begins (so we can assume there aren’t errors in the input arguments to args list).\n\ndevtools::test_active_file()\n\n[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 0 ]\nTEST: START [2025-02-06 08:20:36] COLLECT = collected module values\n[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 1 ]\nTEST: END [2025-02-06 08:20:36] COLLECT = collected module values\nI’ve included the example above because it’s not included on the testServer() documentation, and I’ve found this method works well if you want to confirm two modules are communicating (i.e., returning and collecting outputs).

    "text": "20.1 What is Docker  ?\nDocker ensures your Shiny applications are deployed with the necessary resources (dependencies, libraries, etc.) without significantly interfering with the host operating system or hardware.\nWith Docker, each Shiny application runs from an image in an isolated container, which ensures your app works consistently, regardless of where it’s deployed.1\nImagine a computer as a building and the operating system (OS) is like the big kitchen where everyone cooks. If someone’s (i.e., a software application) recipe calls for the oven to be at a specific temperature or requires a particular ingredient, this can interfere with what someone else (i.e., other applications) wants to make. This situation is somewhat analogous to the competition for resources all software applications have while running on a particular machine.\nDocker images are like different recipes for running software applications, with each recipe requiring different ingredients (requirements, dependencies, libraries, etc.). Docker containers are similar to individual, self-contained mini-kitchens. The mini-kitchens operate independently (with their own appliances, ingredients, and utensils), regardless of what’s happening in the other mini-kitchens.2",

When we instantiate an image, Docker creates a container from that image.3\n\nContainers and images work together but they serve different purposes in the Docker ecosystem.\nWe can place a series of instructions inside a Dockerfile that define how to build a Docker image. The docker build command packages our application, its dependencies, and configurations into a portable image, which can then be used to create and run containers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'monospace', \"fontSize\":\"16px\"}}}%%\n\nflowchart TB\n    subgraph AP[\"App-Package\"]\n        subgraph DockFile[\"&lt;strong&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n            Instructions[[\"&lt;em&gt;Stores instructions&lt;br&gt;for building image&lt;/em&gt;\"]]\n        end\n    end\n        subgraph DockImg[\"&lt;strong&gt;Docker Image&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n            Image[\"Shiny app dependencies\"]\n        end\n\n        subgraph DockCont[\"&lt;strong&gt;Docker Container&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n            R[\"Installs R version\"]\n            Pkg[\"Installs app-package\"]\n            ShinyDep[\"Runs Shiny server\"]\n        end\n\n    DockFile --&gt;|\"&lt;code&gt;docker build&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;creates instance of image&lt;/em&gt;\"| DockImg\n    DockImg --&gt; |\"&lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;creates runtime instance of image&lt;/em&gt;\"|DockCont\n\n    style DockFile fill:#FFFFFF,color:#000000,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,rx:10,ry:10\n    style DockImg fill:#FFFFFF,color:#000000,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,rx:10,ry:10\n    style DockCont fill:#FFFFFF,color:#000000,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,rx:10,ry:10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image containing our applications’ dependencies is safely stored within the container, ensuring consistency across environments.

The port we exposed in the Dockerfile should match the shiny.port option.\n\nCMD R -e \"options('shiny.port'=8180,shiny.host='0.0.0.0');library(sap);sap::launch_app()\"",

    "text": "21.2 Shiny app deployment\nIn this section we’ll be adapting the GitHub Action workflow file provided for deploying a Shiny applications. Before we get to the workflow file, we need to address a few settings and configurations that need to take place outside of the workflow file.\n\n\nLaunch app with the shinypak package:\n\nlaunch('21.2_gha-shiny-deploy')\n\n\n21.2.1 Creating repository secrets\nWe need to make sure our rsconnect secrets are stored with the GitHub repository (so we can access them from within the workflow file). To do this, we’re going to return to the Settings tab on the sap repository, expand Secrets and variables under Security, and select Actions:3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecrets and variables for sap repository\n\n\nUse New repository secret to create three new secrets: RSCONNECT_USER, RSCONNECT_TOKEN, and RSCONNECT_SECRET. You can access these in your shinyapps.io account by clicking on the Tokens tab, then Show and Show secret:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToken from shinyapps.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser and Secret from shinyapps.io\n\n\nWhen you’re finished, should see the following three Repository secrets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepository secrets in sap\n\n\n\n\n21.2.2 Enable private repositories\nWe also need to make sure our shinyapps.io account allows us to install from private GitHub repositories during a workflow deployment. We can do this in the Profile menu item in our dashboard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate Authentication in shinyapps.io profile\n\n\nClicking Update Authentication will open your Posit profile settings, where you can enable private repositories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate repo access also enabled\n\n\n\n\n21.2.3 Capture dependencies\nThe documentation for ‘Shiny App Deployment’ indicates we need to create a renv lockfile in the 21.2_gha-shiny-deploy branch.4\nWe can create the lockfile with the code below:\n\ninstall.packages('renv')\nrenv::init(force = TRUE)\n\nThis project contains a DESCRIPTION file.\nWhich files should renv use for dependency discovery in this project? \n\n1: Use only the DESCRIPTION file. (explicit mode)\n2: Use all files in this project. (implicit mode)\nWe’re going to use the explicit mode, because the dependencies in the DESCRIPTION should be all that’s needed to run and deploy the application.\nSelection: 1\nThis will update the renv.lock file with the packages, their dependencies, and the R version:\n- Linking packages into the project library ... Done!\nThe following package(s) will be updated in the lockfile:\nThe version of R recorded in the lockfile will be updated:\n- Lockfile written to \"~/projects/apps/R/sap/renv.lock\".\n- renv activated -- please restart the R session.\nWe will restart the session to finish creating the new project library.\nAfter renv has discovered and installed the dependencies, the R session will restart and we’ll see the following new folder/files:\n1├── .Rprofile\n├── renv/\n│   ├── activate.R\n2│   └── settings.json\n3└── renv.lock\n\n1\n\n.Rprofile contains a call to source(\"renv/activate.R\"), which manages the project-level dependencies\n\n\n2\n\nrenv settings\n\n\n3\n\nrenv lockfile\n\n\nWhen using renv in package development, we want to be sure to run renv::install() and renv::update():\n\nrenv::install()\n\n\n- There are no packages to install.\n\n\nrenv::update()\n\n\n- Checking for updated packages ... Done!\n- All packages appear to be up-to-date.\n\nNow that we’ve handled our secrets and tokens and have all of our dependencies captured, we can write our workflow file.\n\n\n21.2.4 shiny-deploy.yaml\nWe can include the ‘Shiny App Deployment’ workflow file in sap with usethis::use_github_action(\"shiny-deploy\"):5\n\nusethis::use_github_action(\"shiny-deploy\")\n\n\n✔ Creating .github/.\n✔ Adding \"*.html\" to .github/.gitignore.\n✔ Creating .github/workflows/.\n✔ Saving \"r-lib/actions/examples/shiny-deploy.yaml@v2\" to .github/workflows/shiny-deploy.yaml.\n☐ Learn more at &lt;https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2/examples/README.md&gt;.\n\nThis example workflow file is designed to deploy a Shiny application to a server. We’re going to make a few changes to shiny-deploy.yaml so it will deploy our application to shinyapps.io when we push to the 21.2_gha-shiny-deploy branch.\n\n21.2.4.1 Test run\nThe example shiny workflow includes calls to rsconnect::setAccountInfo() and rsconnect::deployApp(). We’ll perform a test run with these functions to confirm we can deploy the application using the information we’ve collected:\n\nStart by entering your rsconnect info:\n\n\ninstall.packages('rsconnect')\nrsconnect::setAccountInfo(\n  name = \"mjfrigaard\",\n  token = \"YOUR TOKEN\", \n  secret = \"YOUR SECRET\")\n\n\nThen try to deploy the application using rsconnect::deployApp():\n\n\nlibrary(sap)\nrsconnect::deployApp(\n  appName = \"shinyAppPkgsCICD\",\n  account = \"mjfrigaard\",\n  server = \"shinyapps.io\",\n  forceUpdate = TRUE)\n\nReading the deployment log will tells us if the secret, token, configuration, and lockfile are all working:\n\n── Preparing for deployment ──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n✔ Deploying \"shinyAppPkgsCICD\" using \"server: shinyapps.io / username: mjfrigaard\"\nℹ Bundling 50 files: .github/workflows/shiny-deploy.yaml, .Rbuildignore, ..., \ntests/testthat.R, and vignettes/test-specs.Rmd\nℹ Capturing R dependencies with renv\n✔ Found 99 dependencies\n✔ Created 2,431,325b bundle\nℹ Uploading bundle...\n✔ Uploaded bundle with id 8130675\n── Deploying to server ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWaiting for task: 1372980209\n  building: Processing bundle: 8130675\n  building: Building image: 9770352\n  building: Fetching packages\n  building: Installing packages\n  building: Installing files\n  building: Pushing image: 9770352\n  deploying: Starting instances\n  unstaging: Stopping old instances\n── Deployment complete ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n✔ Successfully deployed to &lt;https://mjfrigaard.shinyapps.io/shinyAppPkgsCICD/&gt;\n\nMaking sure an application will deploy locally with the code we plan on putting into the workflow file builds confidence it run when it’s triggered. Now we’re ready to adapt the .github/workflows/shiny-deploy.yaml file.\n\n\n21.2.4.2 Event\nThe event we want to trigger this deployment is a push the 21.2_gha-shiny-deploy branch. We’ll also change of the name of this workflow to shiny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [21.2_gha-shiny-deploy]\n    \nname: shiny\n\n\n\nTriggered event on a push to the 21.2_gha-shiny-deploy branch\nChange name to shiny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'monospace', \"fontSize\":\"16px\"}}}%%\nflowchart TD\n  Push([\"Push to branch\"])\n  Push --&gt;|\"&lt;em&gt;Triggers&lt;/em&gt;\"| Shiny{\"&lt;strong&gt;Job&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt;\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.2.4.3 Jobs\nThe job will set up the runner and pass our stored GITHUB_TOKEN. runs-on launches a runner with the latest Ubuntu operating system and env maps the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable (we can access those secrets with secrets.&lt;SECRET_NAME&gt;).\n\n\n\n\n\n\njobs:\n  shiny:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    env:\n      GITHUB_PAT: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n\njobs remains unchanged, but the identifier should match the name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'monospace', \"fontSize\":\"16px\"}}}%%\nflowchart TD\n  Push([\"Push to branch\"])\n  Push --&gt;|\"&lt;em&gt;Triggers&lt;/em&gt;\"| Shiny{\"&lt;strong&gt;Job&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt;\"}\n    subgraph ubuntu[\"&lt;strong&gt;Runner&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n      Env(\"&lt;strong&gt;Env&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;GITHUB&lt;/code&gt;\")\n    end\n  Shiny --&gt;|\"&lt;em&gt;Runs on: Ubuntu Latest&lt;/em&gt;\"| ubuntu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.2.4.4 Steps\nThe first four steps are actions that clone our repo and set up the environment for performing the tasks in the workflow. The path to the action is passed to uses:, so actions/checkout@v4 uses the YAML file from the actions/checkout repo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-pandoc@v2\n\n      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n          use-public-rspm: true\n          r-version: renv\n\n      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2\n\n\n\nCheck out the repository code\nSet up Pandoc (document conversions)\nSet up R environment.6\nSet up renv to manage the project-specific dependencies captured in renv.lock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'monospace', \"fontSize\":\"16px\"}}}%%\nflowchart TD\n  Push([\"Push to branch\"])\n  Push --&gt;|\"&lt;em&gt;Triggers&lt;/em&gt;\"| Shiny{\"&lt;strong&gt;Job&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt;\"}\n    subgraph ubuntu[\"&lt;strong&gt;Runner&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        PAT(\"&lt;strong&gt;Env&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;GITHUB&lt;/code&gt;\")\n        Checkout(\"&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;: Checkout\")\n        SetupPandoc(\"&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;: Pandoc\")\n        SetupR(\"&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;: R env\")\n        SetupRenv(\"&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;renv&lt;/code&gt;\")\n    end\n  Shiny --&gt;|\"&lt;em&gt;Runs on: Ubuntu Latest&lt;/em&gt;\"| ubuntu\n  PAT --&gt; Checkout --&gt; SetupPandoc --&gt; SetupR\n  SetupR --&gt; SetupRenv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following step is a script (i.e., run:) and it installs the rsconnect package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      - name: Install rsconnect\n        run: install.packages(\"rsconnect\")\n        shell: Rscript {0}\n\n\nInstall rsconnect uses R to install the rsconnect\n\n\n\nNext we use env again to map our account username (mjfrigaard) and app name (shinyDeployApp):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - name: Authorize and deploy app\n      env: \n        APPNAME: shinyDeployApp\n        ACCOUNT: mjfrigaard\n        SERVER: shinyapps.io \n\n\nSets up the environment variables APPNAME, ACCOUNT, and SERVER for authorization\n\n\n\nThe final run step sets the account information using rsconnect::setAccountInfo() and deploys the app to the specified server using rsconnect::deployApp() (we’ll add forceUpdate = TRUE):\n    run: |\n      rsconnect::setAccountInfo(\"${{ secrets.RSCONNECT_USER }}\", \"${{ secrets.RSCONNECT_TOKEN }}\", \"${{ secrets.RSCONNECT_SECRET }}\")\n      rsconnect::deployApp(appName = \"${{ env.APPNAME }}\", account = \"${{ env.ACCOUNT }}\", server = \"${{ env.SERVER }}\", forceUpdate = TRUE)\n    shell: Rscript {0}\nThis will deploy an application at https://&lt;ACCOUNT&gt;.shinyapps.io/&lt;APPNAME&gt;/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'fontFamily': 'monospace', \"fontSize\":\"16px\"}}}%%\nflowchart TD\n  Push([\"Push to branch\"])\n  Push --&gt;|\"&lt;em&gt;Triggers&lt;/em&gt;\"| Shiny{\"&lt;strong&gt;Job&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt;\"}\n    subgraph ubuntu[\"&lt;strong&gt;Runner&lt;/strong&gt;\"]\n        PAT(\"&lt;strong&gt;Env&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;GITHUB&lt;/code&gt;\")\n        Checkout(\"&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;: Checkout\")\n        SetupPandoc(\"&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;: Pandoc\")\n        SetupR(\"&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;: R env\")\n        SetupRenv(\"&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;renv&lt;/code&gt;\")\n        InstallRsconnect(\"&lt;strong&gt;Script&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;rsconnect&lt;/code&gt;\")\n        Auth(\"&lt;strong&gt;Env&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;RSCONNECT&lt;/code&gt;\")\n        Deploy(\"&lt;strong&gt;Script&lt;/strong&gt;: Deploy\")\n    end\n  Shiny --&gt;|\"&lt;em&gt;Runs on: Ubuntu Latest&lt;/em&gt;\"| ubuntu\n  PAT --&gt; Checkout --&gt; SetupPandoc --&gt; SetupR\n  SetupR --&gt; SetupRenv --&gt; InstallRsconnect\n  InstallRsconnect --&gt; Auth --&gt; Deploy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we add, commit, and push the changes to the repo, we see the following deployment log:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"shiny deploy workflow\"\ngit push\n[21.2_gha-shiny 7953a5c] shiny deploy workflow\n 10 files changed, 2130 insertions(+)\n create mode 100644 .Rprofile\n create mode 100644 .github/.gitignore\n create mode 100644 .github/workflows/shiny-deploy.yaml\n create mode 100644 renv.lock\n create mode 100644 renv/.gitignore\n create mode 100644 renv/activate.R\n create mode 100644 renv/settings.json\n create mode 100644 rsconnect/shinyapps.io/mjfrigaard/shinyDeployApp.dcf\nOn GitHub, we can see the workflow running on the Actions tab of the sap repository:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshiny deploy workflow running\n\n\nWhen it’s finished, we can see the deployment log from the workflow looks similar to the log we saw locally:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeploy log from workflow\n\n\nYou can view the deployed application here: https://mjfrigaard.shinyapps.io/shinyDeployApp/",

    "section": "21.3 Actions, Shiny & Docker",
    "text": "21.3 Actions, Shiny & Docker\nWe covered Docker in the previous chapter, which builds and application in an image and containerizes it’s deployment. In this section we’ll combine Docker and GitHub Actions to automate deployment of our app. Automating app deployments will minimize the risk of environmental discrepancies (avoiding the “it works on my machine” problem) and manual deployment processes. Plus, if something goes wrong after a workflow run, rolling back to a previous version in Git is straightforward.\n\n\nLaunch app with the shinypak package:\n\nlaunch('21.3_gha-shiny-docker')\n\n\n21.3.1 Secrets and tokens\nMost of the steps below are covered in the excellent blog post by Nicola Rennie7 I’ve updated the contents to work with a Shiny app-package.\nTo make sure our Connect username, token, and secret travels with our Dockerfile, we will need to store them as environmental variables.\nEnvironmental variables can be set/unset with Sys.setenv()/Sys.unsetenv():\n\nSys.setenv(RSCONNECT_USER = '&lt;username&gt;', \n  RSCONNECT_TOKEN = '&lt;token&gt;', \n  RSCONNECT_SECRET = '&lt;secret&gt;')\n\nThese environmental variables are be passed to rsconnect::setAccountInfo() with a deploy.R file.\n\n\n21.3.2 deploy.R\ndeploy.R contains the calls to rsconnect::setAccountInfo() and rsconnect::deployApp() we had in our previous workflow file. Sys.getenv() will retrieve the username, token, and secret stored with Sys.setenv():\n\nrsconnect::setAccountInfo(name = Sys.getenv(\"RSCONNECT_USER\"),\n               token = Sys.getenv(\"RSCONNECT_TOKEN\"),\n               secret = Sys.getenv(\"RSCONNECT_SECRET\"))\nrsconnect::deployApp(appDir = \".\", \n  appName = \"shinyAppPkgsDockerCiCd\", \n  account = \"mjfrigaard\", \n    server = \"shinyapps.io\", \n    forceUpdate = TRUE)\n\nThe deploy.R script should be placed in the root folder of sap. By default, this will deploy the application launched with app.R. We’ll change this to the application launched with launch_app('ggp2') by changing the contents of app.R to the following:\n\n\nshow/hide updated app.R\nwithr::with_options(new = list(shiny.autoload.r = FALSE), code = {\n  if (!interactive()) {\n    sink(stderr(), type = \"output\")\n    tryCatch(\n      expr = {\n        library(sap)\n      },\n      error = function(e) {\n        pkgload::load_all()\n      }\n    )\n    shinyAppDir(appDir = system.file(\"prod/app\", package = \"sap\"))\n  } else {\n    pkgload::load_all()\n  }\n  launch_app(app = 'ggp2', options = list(test.mode = FALSE))\n})\n\n\n\n\n21.3.3 Dockerfile\nThe Dockerfile will look similar to the example in the Docker chapter, but with a few important changes:\n\nWhen we make the path /home/shinyAppPkgsDockerCiCd with mkdir, this is not only the image location we’ll be launching the application from, but it’s also the URL for the deployed app:\n\nhttps:// username .shinyapps.io/shinyAppPkgsDockerCiCd/\n\nWe’ll include the packages in the DESCRIPTION in our list of dependencies to install, and the remotes and rsconnect packages.\nThe final Rscript command will run the application using our deploy.R file.\n\nFROM rocker/shiny\nRUN mkdir /home/shinyAppPkgsDockerCiCd\nADD . /home/shinyAppPkgsDockerCiCd\nWORKDIR /home/shinyAppPkgsDockerCiCd\nRUN R -e 'install.packages(c(\"bslib\", \"cli\", \"fst\", \"ggplot2\", \"ggplot2movies\", \"logger\", \"pkgload\", \"quarto\", \"ragg\", \"remotes\", \"rlang\", \"rsconnect\", \"sass\", \"shiny\", \"shinytest2\", \"shinythemes\", \"stringr\", \"thematic\", \"tidyr\", \"testthat\", \"tools\", \"waldo\", \"withr\"))'\nRUN R -e 'remotes::install_local(upgrade=\"never\")'\nEXPOSE 8180\nCMD Rscript deploy.R\n\n\n21.3.4 shiny-docker.yml\nIn the .github/workflows folder, we’ll create a shiny-docker.yml file with the following contents:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname: docker-shiny, sap\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ 21.3_gha-shiny-docker ]\n\njobs:\n  docker:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    \n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Build image\n        run: docker build -t sap . \n\n\n\nAdd a name for the Docker/Shiny workflow\nSpecify the triggering event the workflow will run on\nThe job will run on ubuntu-latest (with docker id)\nCheckout the code\nBuild the docker image with docker build\n\n\n\n\nThe final execute step is docker run and it passes our environment variables to the secrets we have stored in GitHub (i.e., with secrets.&lt;SECRET_NAME&gt;):\n      - name: execute\n        run: &gt;\n          docker run -e RSCONNECT_USER=${{ secrets.RSCONNECT_USER }} -e RSCONNECT_TOKEN=${{ secrets.RSCONNECT_TOKEN }}  -e RSCONNECT_SECRET=${{ secrets.RSCONNECT_SECRET }} sap  \n       \n\n\n21.3.5 App dependencies\nrsconnect has a handy appDependencies() function that returns a data.frame of packages, versions, and repositories for your application:\n\nhead(rsconnect:::appDependencies(appDir = \".\"))\n\n\n#        Package Version Source               Repository\n# 1         MASS  7.3-65   CRAN https://cran.rstudio.com\n# 2       Matrix   1.7-2   CRAN https://cran.rstudio.com\n# 3           R6   2.6.1   CRAN https://cran.rstudio.com\n# 4 RColorBrewer   1.1-3   CRAN https://cran.rstudio.com\n# 5         Rcpp  1.0.14   CRAN https://cran.rstudio.com\n# 6    base64enc   0.1-3   CRAN https://cran.rstudio.com\n\nPassing appDependencies() in your app-package’s root directory will tell you if any packages have missing Source or Repository values (this can cause the deployment to fail).\nI also recommend running attachment::att_amend_desc() to capture all the dependencies in the DESCRIPTION. For example, att_amend_desc() added the following packages to the Suggests field in the DESCRIPTION:8\n[+] 2 package(s) added: shinytest2, testthat.\n\n\n21.3.6 Docker build\nIn the docker workflow log, we can see the commands from our Dockerfile executed to install the necessary packages:\n\n\n\nInstalling R packages from Dockerfile\n\n\nAfter installing the dependencies, the sap.tar.gz is installed from *source*:\n\n\n\nBuilding our app-package from *source*\n\n\nThe output above should look familiar–it’s very similar to what we see when we run devtools::load_all().\nAfter installing the dependencies, we can see the Shiny deployment log execute in the workflow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker deploy log\n\n\nView the deployed application here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapturing and recording dependencies with renv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Shiny workflow example above, we captured the application dependencies with renv. However, in this Docker and Shiny workflow, we didn’t create a renv.lock file or a renv/ folder.\nWe get away with this because when the workflow runs, renv is used to capture the dependencies (line 9-12 in the output below). We see a message about the packages listed in the Suggests field or our DESCRIPTION:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker dependencies\n\n\nNot having shinytest2 and testthat packages installed won’t interfere with our application deploying because these packages are listed in the Suggests field in the DESCRIPTION file and are used intests/.",

accompanying tests files.\n\ntest-golem_utils_server.R contains utility functions that might be useful in the server.\ntest-golem_utils_ui.R contains utility functions that might be useful in the UI.\n\ntest-utils_scatter_display.R tests our scatter_plot() utility function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule tests\n\n\n\ntest-mod_var_inputs.R and test-mod_aes_inputs.R test our input modules (see Section 17.2).\nThe communication between our modules is tested in test-mod_scatter_display.R (see Section 17.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem tests\n\n\n\nI’ve moved the two system tests to the shinytest2 vignette:\n\ntest-shinytest2.R is the initial resulting test from shinytest2::record_test() covered in Section 18.3.\ntest-app-feature-01.R tests the data visualization dropdown feature

Below is a brief summary of the steps it took to create gap:\n\nCreated the modules and utility function with add_module() and add_utils().\n\nAdded the bslib layout functions and the thematic theme to app_ui() and golem_add_external_resources().\n\nAdded module server logic to app_server().\n\nDownloaded the golem hex image to inst/app/www/.\n\nDownloaded the movies.RData file into inst/extdata/, then created data-raw/movies.R and created data/movies.rda.\n\nCalled usethis::use_vignette() to create shinytest2.Rmd and tests_and_coverage.Rmd.\n\nAdded the test_logger() utility function to R/utils_tests.R.\n\nRevised the unit tests and moved all system tests to vignettes/shinytest2.Rmd.\n\nIncluded code coverage in README.Rmd with usethis::use_coverage('codecov') and created the tests/README.md file with covrpage::covrpage().\n\nCalled attachment::att_amend_desc() to capture any dependencies.\n\nFinally, I loaded, documented, and installed the gap package and ran the application with gap::run_app().\n\nIf you’ve followed along with the preceding chapters, the golem framework will be familiar.

    "text": "24.2 Development\nThe sections below outline the steps for creating the sap movies review app from scratch using leprechaun.\n\n24.2.1 The R/ folder\nAll leprechaun apps come with primary app UI and server functions (R/ui.R and R/server.R) and a standalone app function (R/run.R.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUI\n\n\n\nui() defines the overall UI structure using navbarPage().\n\nassets() combines the output of serveAssets() (which gathers JS and CSS from inst/assets)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer\n\n\n\nserver() contains the server logic for the application.\n\nsend_message &lt;- make_send_message(session) sets up a utility that lets you easily send messages from R to JavaScript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModules\n\n\n\nCreate new modules with leprechaun::add_module().\n\nThis creates a new R/module_*.R file (see example below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshow/hide R/module_vars.R file\n#' vars UI\n#' \n#' @param id Unique id for module instance.\n#' \n#' @keywords internal\nvarsUI &lt;- function(id){\n    ns &lt;- NS(id)\n\n    tagList(\n        h2(\"vars\")\n    )\n}\n\n#' vars Server\n#' \n#' @param id Unique id for module instance.\n#' \n#' @keywords internal\nvars_server &lt;- function(id){\n    moduleServer(\n        id,\n        function(\n            input, \n            output, \n            session\n            ){\n                \n            ns &lt;- session$ns\n            send_message &lt;- make_send_message(session)\n\n            # your code here\n        }\n    )\n}\n\n# UI\n# varsUI('id')\n\n# server\n# vars_server('id')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun\n\n\n\nR/run.R provides functions to launch your Shiny application in different modes:\n\nrun() is the main function that users will call to launch your application in normal mode.\nrun_dev() is for development purposes and launches a development version of the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets\n\n\n\nThe R/assets.R file contains the following functions:\n\nserveAssets(): scans your package for JavaScript and CSS files, separates regular JavaScript files from “module” type JavaScript files, and bundles everything as proper HTML dependencies that Shiny can use.\nremove_modules(): filters out the module files from the list of all JavaScript files.\nget_modules(): extracts only the module files from the list of all JavaScript files.\ncollapse_files(): creates a regular expression pattern to match specific files.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll use the functions in R/assets.R via the assets() function in the R/ui.R file, which calls serveAssets() to include all any front-end resources in our Shiny app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput handlers\n\n\nR/input-handlers.R sets up custom data handling between your JavaScript front-end and R back-end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleprechaun utilities\n\n\nThe R/leprechaun-utils.R file provides a utility function (make_send_message()) — a helper to send custom messages from the server to the front-end (JavaScript) in a namespace-aware and modular way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR/zzz.R\n\n\n.onLoad() creates a static file server path for images and makes inst/img accessible to the web browser.3\n\n\n\n\n\n24.2.2 The inst/ folder\nleprechaun::scaffold() creates the following folders in inst/:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninst/assets/\n\n\nContains any JavaScript and CSS files that are part of the application frontend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninst/dev/\n\n\nOptional directory used for custom dev scripts, build tools, or staging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninst/img/\n\n\nHolds static image files like logos, icons, or other assets we want to display in the UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninst/run\n\n\nContains the app.R file used for development mode (i.e., with lap::run_dev()).\n\n\n\n\n24.2.2.1 Adding images\nAdding images is simplified with the .onLoad() function, which we can demonstrate by adding an image file to the UI function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace leprechaun-logo.png in inst/img/:\n\n\ninst/\n  └── img/\n       └── leprechaun-logo.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd file path to the UI:\n\n\nbslib::card_header(\n  tags$h4(tags$em(\"Brought to you by \",\n    tags$img(\n      src = \"img/leprechaun-logo.png\",\n      height = 100,\n      width = 100,\n      style = \"margin:10px 10px\"\n      )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n\n\nLoad, document, and install the package, then launch the application with run():\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + L\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + D\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlap::run()\n\n\n\n24.2.2.2 use and build\nThe leprechaun workflow involves a combination of use_ functions that are combined with leprechaun::build() to add various functionality to your application. I’ll demonstrate adding JavaScript and SCSS below.\n\n\n24.2.2.3 Use JavaScript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing packer\n\n\n\nWe’ll use the make_send_message() from the JavaScript example on the package website:\n\nRun packer::scaffold_leprechaun()\n\n\nDon’t be alarmed when scaffold_leprechaun() downloads multiple folders into the root directory. 4\n\n\nRun leprechaun::use_packer()\nRun leprechaun::build()\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates inst/dev/packer.R and inst/assets/index.js.\n\ninst\n├── assets\n│   └── index.js\n├── dev\n│   └── packer.R\n├── extdata\n│   └── movies.RData\n├── img\n└── run\n    └── app.R\n\nAssign the output from make_send_message() to send_message() in R/server.R, then pass the msgId and text of the message:\n\nsend_message &lt;- make_send_message(session)\nsend_message(\"show-packer\",\n              text = \"a message from R/server.R\")\n\n\nCreate send_message()\n\nUse send_message() to send a message the UI.\n\nAfter loading, documenting, and installing your app-package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + L\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + D\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the application:\n\nlap::run()\n\n\n\n\nsend_message() in R/server.R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJS Alerts in Positron\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re using Positron , you’ll have to display the application in the browser to view the alert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding images to inst/img/\n\n\n\n\n24.2.2.4 Use Sass\nTo add Sass styling, we can combine leprechaun’s use_sass() and build() functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleprechaun::use_sass() adds scss/ folder with _core.scss and main.scss.\n\n\nscss\n├── _core.scss\n└── main.scss\n\n1 directory, 2 files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original _core.scss file:\n\n\nhtml{\n    .error {\n        color: red\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the color to green using $accent: #38B44A;\n\n\n$accent: #38B44A;\n\nhtml{\n    h4 {\n        color: $accent;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun leprechaun::build():5\n\n\nleprechaun::build()\n✔ Running packer.R\n✔ Bundled       \n✔ Running sass.R\n\n\n\nOnce again, load, document(), and install lap, then launch the application with run():\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + L\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + D\nCtrl/Cmd + Shift + B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlap::run()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning lap with new Sass\n\n\nIt’s important to note that adding features to your leprechaun app-package will add non-standard directories to the root folder:\n\n├── node_modules/ &lt;- too many sub-folders to list here!\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── scss/\n│   ├── _core.scss\n│   └── main.scss\n├── srcjs/\n│   ├── config\n│   ├── index.js\n│   └── modules\n├── webpack.common.js\n├── webpack.dev.js\n└── webpack.prod.js\n\nThese folders are necessary for adding JavaScript/SCSS functionality, so don’t remove them (just make sure they’re added to the .Rbuildignore/.gitignore)\n\n\n\n24.2.3 Data\nWe can add data to lap the same way we’d add data to any R package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninst/extdata/\n\n\nAdd the movies.RData file to inst/extdata/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata-raw/\n\n\nCreate the movies.R file in data-raw/ with usethis::use_data_raw(\"movies\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata/\n\n\nLoad the movies.RData in data-raw/movies.R and export the file to data/movies.rda using usethis::use_data().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR/\n\n\nDocument the dataset in R/data.R.\n\n\n\n\n\n24.2.4 Documentation\nleprechaun modules and functions include @keywords internal, which can be used in combination with a {pkgname}-package.R file. We can create this file using usethis::use_package_doc():\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following to lap-package.R.\n\n\n#' @keywords internal \n\"_PACKAGE\"\n\n\n\nThe documentation for lap is intentionally sparce:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlap index\n\n\nBy default, run() is the only leprechaun funtion available in the package index (I’ve exported the theme, data, and utility functions).\n\n\n24.2.5 Dependencies\nleprechaun lists bslib, htmltools, and shiny when the app-package is initially buit. If using packer, this application is also added to the DESCRIPTION file with leprechaun::use_packer().\nTo keep track of the add-on packages, I recommend using the attachment package.\n\n\n24.2.6 Tests\nUnit tests in leprechaun apps should be written using the same process/tools as a standard R package/Shiny app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit tests\n\n\nUse testthat to set up the test suite and use_test() to create and open test files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegration tests\n\n\nUse testServer to create tests for module server functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem tests\n\n\nUse shinytest2 for system tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n24.2.7 Deployment\nTo launch our app locally (or using rsconnect::deployApp()), leprechaun has a handy leprechaun::add_app_file() function that creates an app.R file in the root folder with the following contents:\n\n# Launch the ShinyApp \n# do not remove to keep push deploy button\n# from RStudio\npkgload::load_all(\n    reset = TRUE,\n    helpers = FALSE\n)\n\nrun()\n\nThis file shouldn’t be confused with inst/run/app.R:\n\n# do not deploy from this file\n# see leprechaun::add_app_file()\nleprechaun::build()\n\npkgload::load_all(\n    path = \"../../\",\n    reset = TRUE,\n    helpers = FALSE\n)\n\nrun()\n\nThe inst/run/app.R file is specifically used by the run_dev() function.\n\n\nRecap\nleprechaun app-packages have an unopinionated structure and extensive JavaScript frontend support.\n\nBuilding modules is made easier with the add_module() function (although the naming convention could be more consistent).\nThe application is split into separate UI, server, and standalone app functions/files.\nTesting support is not included (but testthat and shinytest2 can be easily implemented).\n\nThe leprechaun framework is ideal for any developer who is comfortable with JavaScript frameworks (e.g., Webpack, Babel, etc.) and want to build custom UIs with Shiny as a backend.",

It’s typical to have data before having an idea for a dashboard or app, so we’ll pass the structure of a simplified version of our movies data to the Shiny Assistant with some instructions on what we’d like to see::2\nPrompt: Create a shiny application that visualizes IMDB movie data using a scatter plot. Include inputs for x, y, color, size, and transparency.\nThe column names are below:\n```\nRows: 651\nColumns: 18\n$ title             …\n$ genre             …\n$ runtime           …\n$ year              …\n$ top200_box        …\n$ director          …\n$ mpaa_rating       …\n$ imdb_rating       …\n$ critics_rating    …\n$ audience_rating   …\n$ imdb_num_votes    …\n$ critics_score     …\n$ audience_score    …\n$ best_pic_nom      …\n$ best_pic_win      …\n$ best_actor_win    …\n$ best_actress_win  …\n$ best_dir_win      …\n```\n\nUse the data stored in this URL:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/sap/refs/heads/26_llm-shiny-assist/data-raw/movies_sample.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Providing data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve found providing a data structure (from str() or dplyr::glimpse()) is incredibly helpful when guiding AI chatbots on building dashboards. Shiny Assistant is great because we can even pass it a URL with a .csv data file.\n\n\n\n\nBelow we can see the initial app:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Assistant: initial app\n\n\nThe initial application has nearly identical input, outputs, and layout. However, we can see an additional checkbox for Show Movie Titles and the Size by input has been mapped to a variable (not a numerical value).\nIn our next prompt, we’ll refine the app to match what we have in sap more closely.\n\n\n26.1.2 Prompt 2: Refine\nPrompt:  Change the size to a numeric slider and include a text input for a plot title. \nThe application is updated with the changesm and we can view the changes to app.R in the Shiny Assistant UI:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Assistant: initial app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: aes_string()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the following warning regarding the ggplot2 graph:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe avoided this warning with the scatter_plot() utility function in previous branches, but for now, we will just note this is something we should return to and refactor after our application is in a complete state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.1.3 Prompt 3: Modularize\nNow that we have a UI with the correct inputs and outputs, we’ll convert these into modules and separate the application into its respective components.\nPrompt:  Convert the inputs and outputs into modules and create a standalone app function that calls separate UI and server functions. \nThe response to this prompt won’t change the app, but we’re given a summary of the changes in the chat:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Assistant: app functions and files\n\n\nResponse:\n\n\nI’ve modified the code to use a modular structure following these changes:\n\nCreated separate modules for:\n\nControls (inputs) - controlsUI and controlsServer\nPlot (output) - plotOutputUI and plotOutputServer\nAbout data section - aboutDataUI (UI only as it’s static)\n\nCreated standalone UI and server functions:\n\nui_function() - assembles all UI components\nserver_function() - coordinates between modules\n\nCreated an application function:\n\nmovie_visualization_app() - bundles everything together\n\nThe communication between modules:\n\nThe controls module returns all inputs as a reactive list\nThe plot module takes two parameters: the data and controls reactives\n\n\nThis modular approach makes the code more maintainable and easier to extend. Each component has a well-defined responsibility, and they communicate through clear interfaces.\n\n\nI’ve left the Shiny Assistant chat setting to Verbose, but this can be changed to return less descriptive details on the code being produced:\n\n\n\nShiny Assistant Chat setting\n\n\n\n\n26.1.4 Prompt 4: Structure\nWe’ll attempt to create individual function files and documentation in a single prompt to begin re-structuring the app as an R package.\nPrompt:  Store the modules, UI, server, and standalone app functions in separate files and include roxygen2 documentation. \nThis results in an error when the Shiny Assistant tries to run our updates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Assistant: error\n\n\nThe response summary tells us what has been changed, but it doesn’t give us advice on (or even acknowledge) the error.\nResponse:\n\n\nI’ve reorganized the code into separate files with roxygen2 documentation:\n\ncontrols_module.R: Contains the UI and server functions for the controls module with full roxygen2 documentation including parameters, return values, and imported functions.\nplot_module.R: Contains the UI and server functions for the plot output module with documentation for both components.\nabout_module.R: Contains the UI function for the about data section.\n**ui.R*: Contains the main UI function that assembles all UI components.\nserver.R: Contains the main server function that coordinates between modules.\napp.R: Contains the standalone app function that sources all other files and runs the application.\n\nEach function includes proper roxygen2 documentation with:\n\nFunction descriptions\nParameter descriptions\nReturn value descriptions\n@importFrom tags for explicit dependencies\n@export tags for functions that should be exported\n\nThe app.R file also includes logic to run the app only if the file is being executed directly in an interactive session.\n\n\n\n\n26.1.5 Prompt 5: Error\nThe error above tells us the bslib::page_sidebar() function isn’t being loaded before runApp() is being called, but the call to library(bslib) is in the app.R file. We’ll see if providing some direction on function/file names and where to call shinyApp() will resolve this error:\nPrompt:  An error occurred because the page_sidebar function could not be found. The app.R file needs to contain the library() and source() calls before the call to shinyApp(). Also, rename the ui.R and server.R to app_ui.R and app_server.R. \nThis results in the following changes to the app code structure:\nResponse:\n\n\nI’ve made the following changes to fix the issues:\n\nRenamed the files:\n\nChanged ui.R to app_ui.R\nChanged server.R to app_server.R\n\nModified the app.R file to:\n\nLoad all required libraries at the beginning of the file\nSource all module and function files\nDefine the movie_visualization_app() function\nCall the function directly (removed the if (interactive()) check to ensure it runs)\n\nMaintained the same structure for all modules and functions\n\nThese changes ensure that:\n\nAll necessary files are sourced before using their functions\nThe application will properly find all functions when running\nThe organization follows a more standard Shiny module structure\n\nThe application should now run without the “page_sidebar function could not be found” error since we’re properly sourcing all the module files before they’re used in the UI and server functions.\n\n\nIn the app.R file, if we explicitly run the call to library(bslib) and then source(\"app_ui.R\") (which contains the call to bslib::page_sidebar()), we see these are executed without errors in the Console:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Assistant: library() and source() calls\n\n\nHowever, when we try to source and call our standalone app function, we see the following error:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Assistant: runApp() error\n\n\nError in runApp(x) :\n  Can't call `runApp()` from within `runApp()`. If your application code \n  contains`runApp()`, please remove it.\nThe error is a little tricky, because the standalone app function calls shinyApp(), not runApp(). But Shiny Assistant launches applications by calling runApp() when we click on the icon in the upper right-hand corner of the source editor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Assistant: run the app using the ‘Run App’ icon\n\n\nClicking on the icon will launch the application (we don’t need to call the standalone app function).\n\n\n26.1.6 Bonus: Theme\nWe have modules, UI and server functions, roxygen2 documentation, and an app.R file. We’ll finish by adding a dark thematic theme:\nPrompt:  Add a dark theme using the thematic package: https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/ \nThe updated app includes a dark theme:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Assistant: thematic theme\n\n\nAnd the summary of changes is below:\nResponse:\n\n\nI’ve integrated the thematic package to add a dark theme to the application. Here are the changes I made:\n\nAdded library(thematic) to the app.R file to load the thematic package.\nAdded thematic_shiny(font = \"auto\") to automatically adjust plot themes to match the app theme. This automatically styles the ggplot2 visualizations to match the Shiny app’s theme.\nModified the UI function in app_ui.R to use a dark theme:\n\nCreated a dark theme using bs_theme() from bslib with dark background colors, light text, and appropriate accent colors\nApplied the theme to the page_sidebar() using the theme parameter\n\nUpdated the plot_module.R to work with thematic:\n\nRemoved the explicit theme_minimal() call since thematic will handle the base theming\nKept specific theme adjustments for title styling and legend positioning\n\n\nThe thematic package now automatically coordinates the ggplot2 theme with the application’s dark theme, creating a cohesive dark mode experience throughout the entire application. The plots will automatically inherit the dark background and appropriate colors for text and elements.",

With the right prompting, the application code can be easily structured into an R package. The only caveats I’ve found are:\n\nDeprecated functions: the ggplot2 (aes_string()) warning is an example of somthing that might require more specific prompting (or knowledge of rlang/ggplot2).\nDocumentation/Dependencies: the roxygen2 documentation generated by Shiny Assistant used copius @importFrom and @import tags, which is something we want to avoid.\nModule structure: Shiny Assistant came up with a different module structure than we had in our previous branches, but that’s not to say it’s incorrect. However, it’s important to check the reactivity and understand how the namespaces and reactive inputs are managed in the application before putting it into production.",

    "text": "27.1 Installing ellmer\nThe ellmer package gives us access to LLM providers and serves as the ‘backbone’ for other R/LLM packages (we used it to set up the ensure package for writing unit tests in Section 16.1, and we’ll use it again in Chapter 28, Chapter 29, and Chapter 30).\nellmer has been thoughtfully developed, is easy to use, and has excellent documentation and examples. This chapter will briefly cover using ellmer’s chat tool in app-package development.\nInstall ellmer like you would any other package:\ninstall.packages('ellmer')\n# or the dev version\npak::pak('tidyverse/ellmer')",

    "text": "27.1.1 LLM Provider\nAfter installing the package, we must set up an LLM model provider. ellmer provides 10+ LLM provider options, but for this example, I’ll use the OpenAI model, which requires an API key (OPENAI_API_KEY) that can be set in the .Renviron file.1\n\n\n27.1.2 Using the chat\nTo start a chat, we can call ellmer::chat_openai() and specify the model we want to use.2 We should also be sure to record any system_prompts and the number of turns we’ll be using.\n\nlibrary(ellmer)\nchat &lt;- chat_openai(model = \"o1-mini\")\n\nUsing model = \"o1-mini\".\nThe chat object can be used directly in the console to submit prompts and get responses.\n\nchat$chat(\"\n  What are the benefits of developing my Shiny application in an R package?\n  Answer in a markdown-formatted bulleted list.\n\")\n\n\n- **Enhanced Code Organization**\n  - Structure your application with a standardized file hierarchy, making the codebase \neasier to navigate and maintain.\n\n- **Reusable Components**\n  - Develop modular functions and components that can be easily reused across different\nprojects or parts of the application.\n\n- **Dependency Management**\n  - Clearly specify and manage package dependencies, ensuring that all necessary \nlibraries are installed and up to date.\n\n- **Simplified Testing**\n  - Utilize built-in testing frameworks to implement unit tests and ensure the \nreliability of your application.\n\n- **Comprehensive Documentation**\n  - Provide detailed documentation for functions and features using tools like \nRoxygen2, improving understandability for users and contributors.\n\n- **Namespace Control**\n  - Avoid function name conflicts and manage the scope of your functions effectively \nthrough namespaces.\n\n- **Ease of Distribution**\n  - Share your Shiny application effortlessly by distributing it as an R package \nthrough platforms like CRAN or GitHub.\n\n- **Version Control Integration**\n  - Manage and track changes systematically with version control systems, facilitating \ncollaboration and rollback capabilities.\n\n- **Streamlined Deployment**\n  - Leverage package tools for easier deployment to servers or Shiny hosting services, \nensuring a smoother launch process.\n\n- **Community Contributions**\n  - Enable others to contribute to your application more easily by following standard \npackage development practices, fostering community growth.\n\nWe can copy and paste the output into any Markdown document (vignettes, README, etc.).\n\n\n27.1.3 Prompts\nIf we plan on conversing with an LLM, we should pick a location to store our prompts (and responses). The ellmer authors recommend storing these in inst/prompts, with a sensible naming convention.3",

    "text": "27.2 Movie explorer redux\nWe will use ellmer to help us convert an existing Shiny app into a Shiny app-package. The application comes from the Shiny Examples GitHub repo. The README.md from the original app is available below:\n\n\nLaunch app with the shinypak package:\n\nlaunch('27_llm-ellmer')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n051-movie-explorer app\n\n\n\n\nThis is the source code for a movie explorer app which runs on R and Shiny. The data is a subset of data from OMDb, which in turn is from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. The data is saved in a SQLite database.\nTo run it locally, you’ll need to install the latest versions of ggvis, Shiny, and dplyr, as well as RSQLite.\ninstall.packages(c('shiny', 'ggvis', 'dplyr', 'RSQLite'))\nYou may need to restart R to make sure the newly-installed packages work properly.\nAfter all these packages are installed, you can run this app by entering the directory, and then running the following in R:\nshiny::runApp()\n\n\n\nThe application files are also stored in the inst/051-movie-explorer folder of this branch:\ninst/051-movies-explorer/\n├── DESCRIPTION\n├── README.md\n├── global.R\n├── movies.db\n├── server.R\n└── ui.R\n\n1 directory, 6 files\n\n27.2.1 System Prompt\nWe’ll start by passing a system_prompt to chat$chat() to provide some additional information on how the model should respond:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem prompts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshow/hide system_prompt\nlibrary(ellmer)\nchat &lt;- chat_openai(model = \"o1\", \n    system_prompt = \"\n  You are an expert Shiny developer and R package author. Return responses in \n  markdown.\n  \n  Follow the tidyverse style guide:\n  * Limit code to 80 characters per line   \n  * File names should be machine readable (no spaces, symbols, or special \n    characters)   \n  * Variables and function names should all be `snake_case` (i.e., lowercase \n    letters, numbers, and underscores to separate words within a name).   \n  * Place a space before and after `=`   \n  * Avoid empty lines at the start or end of functions   \n  * Only use a single empty line when needed to separate functions or pipes   \n  * Use verbs for function names   \n  * If a function name and definition can’t fit on a single line, indent the \n    argument name with a single indent (i.e. two spaces).   \n  * Comments should be in sentence case   \n  * Spread long function calls across multiple lines    \n  * Always use double quotes for strings   \n  * Use double quotes, not single quotes, for quoting text   \n  * Use base pipe `|&gt;` (not `%&gt;%`)    \n  \")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve modeled this system_prompt off the example in the ellmer documentation,4 but this can be used to specify expertise, coding style preferences (tidyverse/base R), etc.\n\n\n27.2.2 Prompt 1: update\nPrompt 1: The first prompt (stored in inst/prompts/prompt-01-refactor-mods-functions.md) will focus on creating modules, UI and server functions, and a standalone app function. We’ll provide the ui.R and server.R code, and some module and function name instructions.

The inputs in the sidebar are somewhat cramped and out of view, but we can adjust this with future prompts (or by manually editing the UI components).\n\n\n\n27.2.3 Prompt 2: refactor\nPrompt 2: The second prompt will focus on creating utility functions for the database connection and joining/wrangling the data. I’ve stored the instructions in inst/prompts/prompt-02-utility-functions.md (we’ll use the same system_prompt).\nThe goal with this prompt is to create testable utility functions and address the dplyr::src_sqlite() warning we’re getting from our database connection:\nWarning: `src_sqlite()` was deprecated in dplyr 1.0.0.\nℹ Please use `tbl()` directly with a database connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt text 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshow/hide prompt 2\nchat$chat(\"\nConvert the following code into two utility functions for 1) establishing a \nconnection to the `movies.db` database, and 2) joining the omdb and tomatoes\ntables, filtering to `Reviews &gt;= 10`, and selecting the necessary columns.\n\n\\`\\`\\`r\ndb_con.R \n# Set up handles to database tables on app start\ndb &lt;- dplyr::src_sqlite(path = 'movies.db')\nomdb &lt;- dplyr::tbl(db, 'omdb')\ntomatoes &lt;- dplyr::tbl(db, 'tomatoes')\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\n\\`\\`\\`r\n# Join tables, filter out those with &lt;10 reviews, and select\nall_movies &lt;- dplyr::inner_join(omdb, tomatoes, by = 'ID') |&gt;\ndplyr::filter(Reviews &gt;= 10) |&gt;\ndplyr::select(\n    ID, imdbID, Title, Year, Rating_m = Rating.x, Runtime, Genre,\n    Released, Director, Writer, imdbRating, imdbVotes, Language,\n    Country, Oscars, Rating = Rating.y, Meter, Reviews, Fresh, Rotten,\n    userMeter, userRating, userReviews, BoxOffice, Production, Cast\n)\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.2.3.1 Response 2: refactor\nThe response includes two new functions: connect_database() and get_all_movies():\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse text 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshow/hide connect_database.R\n# connect_database.R\nconnect_database &lt;- function(db_path = \"movies.db\") {\n  # Create a handle to the movies database\n  db &lt;- dplyr::src_sqlite(path = db_path)\n  db\n}\n\n\n\n\nshow/hide get_all_movies.R\n# get_all_movies.R\nget_all_movies &lt;- function(db) {\n  # Join tables, filter out those with &lt;10 reviews, and select columns\n  omdb &lt;- dplyr::tbl(db, \"omdb\")\n  tomatoes &lt;- dplyr::tbl(db, \"tomatoes\")\n  \n  all_movies &lt;- dplyr::inner_join(\n    x = omdb,\n    y = tomatoes,\n    by = \"ID\"\n  ) |&gt;\n    dplyr::filter(Reviews &gt;= 10) |&gt;\n    dplyr::select(\n      ID, imdbID, Title, Year, Rating_m = Rating.x, Runtime, Genre,\n      Released, Director, Writer, imdbRating, imdbVotes, Language,\n      Country, Oscars, Rating = Rating.y, Meter, Reviews,\n      Fresh, Rotten, userMeter, userRating, userReviews, BoxOffice,\n      Production, Cast\n    )\n  \n  all_movies\n}\n\n\nExplanation\n• connect_database() is a simple function that uses dplyr::src_sqlite() to connect to the movies.db SQLite database, returning the database connection object.\n• get_all_movies() pulls the omdb and tomatoes tables, joins them, filters for Reviews ≥ 10, and selects the required columns.\n\n\n\n\nconnect_database() still uses dplyr::src_sqlite(), so we’ll rewrite this function to address the warning, move the movies.db file into the inst/extdata6 folder, and access the file with system.file():\n\nconnect_database &lt;- function(pkg, db) {\n  # Create connection to movies database\n  con &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),\n              system.file(\"extdata\", db, package = pkg))\n  con\n}\n\nWe’ll also need to update the db_app_server() function to use the new utility functions:\n\ndb_app_server &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  # Set up connection to database tables on app start\n1  db &lt;- connect_database(pkg = \"sap\", db = \"movies.db\")\n  \n  # Join tables, filter out those with &lt;10 reviews, and select\n2  all_movies &lt;- get_all_movies(db = db)\n  \n  # Call module for inputs\n  inputs_reactive &lt;- mod_graph_inputs_server(\n    id = \"graph_inputs\",\n    all_movies = all_movies\n  )\n  \n  # Call module for outputs\n  mod_graph_output_server(\n    id = \"graph_outputs\",\n    inputs_list = inputs_reactive\n  )\n}\n\n\n1\n\nReplaces the dplyr::src_sqlite() and dplyr::tbl() calls.\n\n\n2\n\nReplaces the dplyr::inner_join(), dplyr::filter(), and dplyr::select() functions.\n\n\n\n\nTo implement these changes, we’ll need to add the new function files to the inst/db_app/R folder:\ninst/db_app/\n├── R\n│   ├── connect_database.R\n│   ├── db_app_server.R\n│   ├── db_app_ui.R\n│   ├── get_all_movies.R\n│   ├── global.R\n│   ├── mod_graph_inputs.R\n│   └── mod_graph_output.R\n└── app.R\n\n2 directories, 8 files\nThis results in the following application:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated inst/db_app app\n\n\nWe can see the dplyr::src_sqlite() warning is gone and the data are correctly loaded in the application.\n\n\n\n27.2.4 Prompt 3: overhaul\nPrompt 3: We’ll get even more detailed in the third prompt (stored in inst/prompts/prompt-03-app-ast-design.md). In these instructions, we’ll include an abstract syntax tree (courtesy of lobstr::ast()) with the proposed structure, function names, and a description:\n█─launch_app \n├─█─db_app_ui \n│ ├─█─mod_select_input_ui \n│ ├─█─mod_slider_input_ui \n│ ├─█─mod_text_input_ui \n│ ├─█─mod_points_plotly_ui \n│ └─█─mod_table_ui \n└─█─db_app_server \n  ├─█─db_con \n  │ └─█─join_movies_tbls \n  ├─█─mod_slider_input_server \n  ├─█─mod_select_input_server \n  ├─█─mod_text_input_server \n  ├─█─mod_table_server \n  └─█─mod_points_plotly_server \n    └─█─scatter_plotly \nI’ve found this practice is helpful when writing prompts that request nested functions (like modules).

Below is an example of the roxygen helper in Positron  with our name_case() function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\n\nchores doesn’t write comprehensive documentation, but it will\n\n“generate a subset of a complete documentation entry, to be then completed by a developer:”\n\nSpecifically, it will write the @title, @description, any arguments (i.e., @param), and what the function @returns. The chores helper will also export the function by default.\nThe chores helper returned the following roxygen2 documentation:\n\n#' Change the case of text\n#'\n#' @param x A character vector.\n#' @param case One of `\"title\"` or `\"lower\"`. Optional.\n#'\n#' @returns\n#' A character vector with the case changed according to the specified format.\n#' Will error if input is not a character vector or if an unsupported case is specified.\n#'\n#' @export\n\nThe mod_compare_vars_ui() function is also demonstrated below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP: Padding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI recommend placing about 10 lines of extra padding above the function you’re using chores to document in Positron . I’ve found this ensures the first few lines of the function aren’t overwritten by the helper response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\n\nThe roxygen2 documentation for the mod_compare_vars_ui() function is below:\n\n#' UI module for comparing movie variables\n#'\n#' @param id A string.

These prompts can be written in markdown and must be named either replace, prefix, or suffix.\nreplace: removes the highlighted text and replaces it with a response.\nprefix: inserts a response above the highlighted text.\nsuffix: places the response below the highlighted text.\nBelow is a shinymod-prefix helper prompt that has some specific instructions for documenting Shiny modules (see Section 5.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninst/prompts/shinymod-prefix.md\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninst/prompts/shinymod-prefix.md\nYou are an expert Shiny developer who loves providing detailed explanations of complex topics to non-technical audiences.\nFollow the tidyverse style guide:\n\nLimit code to 80 characters per line\n\nPlace a space before and after =\n\nOnly use a single empty line when needed to separate sections\n\nAlways use double quotes for strings\n\nAlways use backticks for inline code\n\nUse double quotes, not single quotes, for quoting text\n\nUse base pipe |&gt; (not %&gt;%)\n\nReference UI/server functions using brackets\n\nUse the following documentation for the aes() function from ggplot2 as an example:\n#' Construct aesthetic mappings\n#'\n#' Aesthetic mappings describe how variables in the data are mapped to visual\n#' properties (aesthetics) of geoms. Aesthetic mappings can be set in\n#' [ggplot()] and in individual layers.\n#'\n#' This function also standardises aesthetic names by converting `color` to \n#' `colour` (also in substrings, e.g., `point_color` to `point_colour`) and\n#' translating old style R names to ggplot names (e.g., `pch` to `shape` \n#' and `cex` to `size`).\n\nWhen documenting a UI function, reference the corresponding server function (and vice versa).\n\nFor example, mod_vars_ui() should reference mod_vars_server().\n\n\nmod_vars_ui &lt;- function(id) {\n  ns &lt;- NS(id)\n    tagList(\n        varSelectInput(\n          inputId = ns('chr_var'),\n          label = strong('Group variable'),\n          data = chr_data,\n          selected = 'Critics Rating'\n        )\n    )\n}\nmod_vars_server &lt;- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {    \n    return(\n      reactive({\n        list(\n          'chr_var' = input$chr_var\n        )\n      })\n    )\n  })\n}\nExample documentation for mod_vars_ui():\n#' UI for count variables module\n#'\n#' Creates inputs for selecting a grouping variable. This function is designed\n#' to work together with [mod_vars_server()].\n#'\n#' @param id A character string used to identify the namespace for the module.\n#'\n#' @return A `tagList` containing UI elements:\n#'  * A variable select input for the grouping variable\n#'\n#' @seealso [mod_vars_server()] for the server-side logic\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' # UI implementation\n#' ui &lt;- fluidPage(\n#'   mod_vars_ui('vars1')\n#' )\n#'\n#' # Server implementation\n#' server &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n#'   vars &lt;- mod_vars_server('vars1')\n#' }\n#'\n\nIndicate if returned values are reactive.\n\nReturn responses in roxygen2 comments (no R code blocks)\n\nInclude 5 blank lines of ‘padding’ after all responses\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add a custom helper to the chores addin, you can provide the URL to a raw markdown file on GitHub using chores::prompt_new():\n\nchores::prompt_new(\n  \"shinymod\", \n  \"prefix\", \n  contents = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/chorrrin/refs/heads/main/inst/prompts/shinymod-prefix.md\"\n)\n\n\n28.4.1 Extension packages\nIf you have a collection of repetitive tasks you’d like to include in the chores addin, you can create and install a small extension package. For example, I’ve created the chorrrin extension package.5\n\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"mjfrigaard/chorrrin\")\nlibrary(chorrrin)\n\nchorrrin includes a modlog-replace helper for re-writing Shiny modules using the logger package (we covered this in Section 13.3.3) and a modtest-replace for writing Shiny module tests using Shiny’s testServer() function (see Testing modules).\nThis allows me to highlight the module function I’d like to add log messages to, hit the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Cmd + C), select my custom helper, click Enter, and voilà!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample modlog helper in Positron\n\n\nThe chores extension goes to work re-writing the module function with the log messages (following the helper prompt I provided).",

Let me start by \nexploring your project structure to understand what we're working with.\nTo perform this exploration, the model will use the registered tools from btw.\n\n30.5.1 Registered tools\nWhen registering a tool with an LLM, we include the name of the function, a description of what the function does, and a list of function arguments with their type (boolean, integer, number, etc.). 8\nWe can view all the tools registered with the LLM using:\n\nchat$get_tools()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe btw_tools() function lists all the tools we could register, but chat$get_tools() returns the tools that are registered with the model.\n\n\n\n\nThe output from chat$get_tools() is rather lengthy, but we can use Ctrl/Cmd + F to locate btw_tool_files_list_files(), which is the first tool called by the LLM.\nList files or directories in the project.\n\nWHEN TO USE:\n* Use this tool to discover the file structure of a project.\n* When you want to understand the project structure, use `type = \"directory\"` to list all directories.\n* When you want to find a specific file, use `type = \"file\"` and `regexp` to filter files by name or extension.\n\nCAUTION: Do not list all files in a project, instead prefer listing files in a specific directory with a `regexp` to\nfilter to files of interest.\n\n\n30.5.2 Tool calls\nRecall the model was going to start by ‘exploring your project structure’, and we can see this aligns with the’ @description for btw_tool_files_list_files().\nIn the console, the tool call and a preview of it’s results are printed. Below is the first call to btw_tool_files_list_files():\n◯ [tool call] btw_tool_files_list_files(path = \".\", `_intent` = \"Get initial \noverview of project structure\")\nThe function includes an _intent argument, where the model, “explain[s] why it called the tool.”9\n\n\n30.5.3 Tool results\nThe results are a markdown formatted table of the project contents (file/folder names, their size, and when they were last changed):10\n● #&gt; | path        | type      | size | modification_time   |\n  #&gt; |-------------|-----------|------|---------------------|\n  #&gt; | DESCRIPTION | file      | 736  | 2025-10-20 14:04:24 |\n  #&gt; | NAMESPACE   | file      | 932  | 2025-10-22 08:01:23 |\n  #&gt; | R           | directory | 1K   | 2025-10-22 08:01:23 |\n  #&gt; …\n\n\n30.5.4 Model response\nThe table output is sent to the LLM, which them provides a summary of the contents:\nPerfect!

The PHASE 1: SUMMARY is what the model learned about the sap package using the btw tools (expand the callout box to view):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHASE 1: SUMMARY (TOOL CALLS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on my exploration, here’s what I’ve learned about this project:\nProject Type: R Package with integrated Shiny application\nPrimary Purpose: This is sap (Shiny App-Packages), which serves as a comprehensive code example for the book “Shiny App-Packages” and workshops on developing/testing Shiny applications. It demonstrates how to structure a Shiny app as an R package.\nTechnology Stack:\n\nR Package structure (DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE, man/, tests/)\n\nShiny for the web application with modular design\n\nBootstrap/bslib for modern UI theming\n\nggplot2 + extensions (ggdist, ggwaffle, plotly) for visualizations\n\ntidyverse (dplyr, tidyr, forcats) for data manipulation\n\ntestthat for comprehensive testing\n\nrenv for dependency management\n\nQuarto for vignettes/documentation\n\nKey Architecture Insights:\n\nModular Shiny design: Extensive use of Shiny modules (mod_*.R files) for different app sections\n\nMulti-branch educational repo: Different branches show progressive development stages\n\nTheme integration: Dark theme with custom CSS and thematic integration\n\nData-focused: Built around IMDB movie review dataset with 34 variables\n\nProduction-ready structure: Complete with testing, documentation, and dependency management\n\nMain Components:\n\nData visualization modules: Compare plots, distribution plots, count plots (bar/waffle)\n\nAward analysis: Special modules for Oscar/award winner analysis\n\nTabular displays: Data tables with custom styling\n\nReport generation: Quarto-based reporting functionality\n\nThe app appears to provide multiple ways to explore and visualize movie review data through an interactive interface, while serving as a teaching tool for Shiny app development best practices.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the project summary, the model starts Phase 2: Narrative Construction, which includes a series of questions from the LLM regarding the context of the package/project (expand the callout box to view).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHASE 2: NARRATIVE CONSTRUCTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow moving to Phase 2: Narrative Construction. I need to gather context that would help developers understand the “why” behind decisions and architectural choices.\nQuestion 1: What’s the main learning objective for developers using this codebase–is it primarily about demonstrating Shiny package structure, modular Shiny development patterns, or both equally?\n\n“The learning objectives for developers using the codebase are to demonstrate Shiny package structure and modular Shiny development patterns, specifically using modules to add a downloadable html report. Be sure to also create mermaid diagrams to illustrate concepts. When creating mermaid diagrams, list the nodes using CamelCase abbreviations (i.e., not simply A, B, C, etc.), and keep the diagrams small enough to fit on a single presentation slide.”\n\nQuestion 2: I noticed the app uses a dark theme with custom CSS and thematic integration. Was this theming choice made primarily for visual appeal, or does it serve as an example of a specific theming pattern that developers should learn from when building their own Shiny app-packages?\n\n“The theme is just for visual appeal, not as an example of a specific theming pattern.”\n\nQuestion 3: I see the project has multiple branches representing different development stages, and the main branch appears to be a mature version with full testing and documentation. For developers working with this codebase, which components or modules would you recommend they examine first to understand the core patterns–are there particular modules that best demonstrate the key architectural principles?\n\n“The code files for each chapter are stored in Git repository. Major code changes are stored in branches. The branches are named sequentially with a prefix and a name of the topic covered: 01_whole-app-game, 02.1_shiny-app, 02.2_movies-app, 02.3_proj-app, 03.1_description, 03.2_rproj, 03.3_create-package, 04_devtools, 05_roxygen2, 06.1_exports, 06.2_imports, 07_data, 08_launch, 09_inst, etc. Developers should review the three mod_compare_* to understand the core patterns (these best demonstrate the key architectural principles).”\n\nQuestion 4: The modular structure shows three mod_compare_* modules (vars, point, and presumably the UI/server pairs). These modules appear to handle variable selection, point plotting, and the overall comparison interface. Are there specific patterns in how these three modules communicate with each other–like how data flows between variable selection and plotting–that represent key principles developers should understand about module interaction in Shiny app-packages?\n\n“Developers should understand that using modules enhances the clarity of the application by providing a structured way to organize its components. This approach allows us to write, analyze, and test each element independently, making it easier to understand its unique functionality and how it interacts within the overall app server.”\n\nQuestion 5: I see the app integrates Quarto for report generation and has a dedicated mod_report module. Given that downloadable HTML reports are a key learning objective, is the report functionality designed to demonstrate a specific pattern for integrating external document generation tools (like Quarto) within Shiny modules, or does it showcase something else important about report generation in app-packages?\n\n“The only learning objective is using Shiny modules to integrate external document generation tools (like Quarto). This is a general pattern, not a specific pattern.”\n\nPerfect! I now have enough context to create the documentation. Let me summarize what I understand:\n\n\n\n\nI included some instructions to the model on building mermaid diagrams for the btw.md file. The PHASE 2: SUMMARY returned after the questions and answers is below (expand the callout box to view).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHASE 2: SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives: Demonstrate both Shiny package structure and modular Shiny development patterns, with special focus on using modules to integrate external document generation (Quarto for HTML reports).\nKey Architectural Principles:\n\nModular design enhances application clarity through structured component organization\n\nEach module can be written, analyzed, and tested independently\n\nFocus on the three mod_compare_* modules as the best examples of core patterns\n\nGeneral pattern for integrating external tools (like Quarto) within Shiny modules\n\nDevelopment Progression: Sequential git branches show evolution from basic app to full package structure, following a clear learning path through the book chapters.\nTheme Choice: Visual appeal only, not a teaching pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30.5.5 Updated bwd.md file\nWhen Phase 2 is complete, we’re told we have a “comprehensive btw.md file that captures the essential information about [our] Shiny App-Packages project.” The full conversation with the model is stored in inst/prompts/btw-md-conversation.md.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Features of the Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📋 Learning-Focused Structure: Emphasizes the dual educational objectives (package structure + modular patterns) right at the top\n🎯 Clear Architecture Diagrams: Two mermaid diagrams showing:\n\nOverall module architecture with CamelCase node names\n\nCore module communication pattern (CompareVars → ComparePoint → Report)\n\n📚 Sequential Learning Path: Explains the git branch progression from basic app to full package\n🔧 Practical Developer Guidance:\n\nPoints developers to the three mod_compare_* modules as the best starting examples\n\nIncludes actual commands for exploring different development stages\n\nTesting patterns for module independence\n\n📊 Data Context: Clear explanation of the movie dataset structure and its role in demonstrating patterns\n🚀 Integration Patterns: Specific focus on how Quarto integration demonstrates external tool patterns\nThe documentation serves both as an introduction for newcomers and a reference for developers working with the codebase. It maintains the existing front matter you had while providing comprehensive context that helps developers understand not just what the code does, but why it’s structured this way for learning purposes.\nThe file should help other AI assistants and developers quickly understand that this is an educational codebase with specific learning objectives, rather than a production movie analysis application.\n\n\n\n\nView the updated btw.md file.",

The package contains a list of ‘linters’ for various potential problems and can be customized according to your needs. lintr is designed to help improve your code’s quality and readability by generating reports in the ‘markers’ pane. Running lintr won’t automatically correct the identified issues (you’ll need to fix the linting issues it reports manually).\n\n\n32.1.2 styler\nOn the other hand, the purpose of styler is to ensure consistency in the code formatting, which is crucial if you’re working in a team or contributing to open-source projects (like tidyverse packages). The styler package will change your code’s format according to specified style guidelines. These changes include indentation, spaces, and line breaks that adhere to your style guidelines.\nWhile there is some overlap (both packages can help enforce coding style guidelines), lintr is a more general tool for code quality, spotting potential issues and bugs. At the same time, styler focuses on code formatting and can automatically apply fixes. Many developers find combining both can help catch potential issues and ensure a consistent, readable coding style.",

Note that values taken from the reactiveValues() object are reactive, but the reactiveValues() object itself is not.” Shiny Documentation\n\nI’ve added emphasis to the quote above because it’s important to remember that any object assign to reactiveValue() should be treated like any reactive object (i.e., and inputId or object returned from reactive() or observe()).3\nFor example, if we try to access the input values as a list outside movies_server() or the module server function, we see the following error:4\n\nx &lt;- reactiveValues(\n  inputs = list(x = \"imdb_rating\",\n                y = \"audience_score\",\n                z = \"mpaa_rating\",\n                alpha = 0.5,\n                size = 2,\n                plot_title = \"Enter Plot Title\")\n  )\nx$inputs()\n\n\n## Error in `x$inputs`:\n## !

That’s why when we change any of the UI inputs, the values change in rVals$inputs() and in the inputs() object inside the display module.\nYou can also view these outputs using launch_app(run = 'b', bslib = TRUE).\n\n\n33.1.5 Testing reactiveValues()\nIf you decide to use reactiveValues() or session$userData, you’ll need to confirm these objects in your tests. The module tests for test-mod_scatter_display.R have been redesigned to handle the reactiveValues() input.5\nI’ll briefly summarize the changes below:\n\nargs = list() in testServer() now takes the output from helper functions (stored in tests/testthat/helper.R and R/testthat.R). 6\n\nmake_initial_rVals_inputs &lt;- function() {\n  rVals &lt;- reactiveValues(\n    inputs =\n      reactive(list(\n        x = \"imdb_rating\",\n        y = \"audience_score\",\n        z = \"mpaa_rating\",\n        alpha = 0.5,\n        size = 2,\n        plot_title = \"Enter Plot Title\"\n      ))\n  )\n  return(rVals)\n}\n\nThis creates a reaciveValues() list that can be used in the test:\n\nrVals &lt;- make_initial_rVals_inputs()\nrVals\n## &lt;ReactiveValues&gt; \n##   Values:    inputs \n##   Readonly:  FALSE\n\nWe can view it’s contents by wrapping it in isolate().\n\nisolate(rVals$inputs())\n## $x\n## [1] \"imdb_rating\"\n## \n## $y\n## [1] \"audience_score\"\n## \n## $z\n## [1] \"mpaa_rating\"\n## \n## $alpha\n## [1] 0.5\n## \n## $size\n## [1] 2\n## \n## $plot_title\n## [1] \"Enter Plot Title\"\n\nPassing make_initial_rVals_inputs() to the args in testServer() requires creating rVals (which can be referenced in the test as rVals$inputs():\n\n    shiny::testServer(app = mod_scatter_display_server,\n      args = list(rVals = make_initial_rVals_inputs()), expr = {\n        testthat::expect_equal(\n          object = rVals$inputs(),\n          expected = list(\n                x = \"imdb_rating\",\n                y = \"audience_score\",\n                z = \"mpaa_rating\",\n                alpha = 0.5,\n                size = 2,\n                plot_title = \"Enter Plot Title\"\n            )\n        )\n      })",

This point is covered in more detail in this blog post.\n\n“reusing objects passed through session violates module independence – there is code inside the module that uses external objects without stating them explicitly as server arguments.”",

While Shiny is inherently reactive and functional, R6 classes provide a powerful tool for encapsulating state, behavior, and logic — particularly useful in large-scale apps or when designing reusable components inside an R package.\nIn this chapter, we’ll explore:\nR6 is an object-oriented system in R that enables the creation of reference-based objects. Unlike S3 or S4 objects, R6 objects maintain state and support encapsulation, inheritance, and private/public members — much like objects in other OOP languages (e.g., Python, Java).\nThis makes R6 especially useful for:\nIn an app packaged as an R package, R6 classes help you separate concerns and avoid global state.",

    "text": "App-package: An app-package is a package containing a shiny application. App-packages have all of the functionality of a standard R package, but also contain the files and folders required to successfully develop, run, and deploy a Shiny application. See the Shiny and Packages chapters for more information.1\nExternal resource/file: In Shiny app-packages, external files or resources are files used in the application that aren’t part of a standard R package. These can include images (.jpg, .png, etc.), JavaScript files (.js), and CSS or Sass styling (.css, .sass). See the Resources chapter for more information.2\nModule: Shiny modules3 are a pair of UI and server functions (linked by a shared id) to create a shared by isolated namespace. Using modules in a shiny application makes it possible to isolate individual components of an application during development. Additionally, since modules are functions, they can be reused throughout the application (and tested using Shiny’s testServer() function). See the Shiny chapter for more information.4\nPackage: A directory of functions, documentation, and/or data that can be installed and loaded into an R session. R packages include the necessary dependency management (NAMESPACE) and metadata files (DESCRIPTION). In Shiny App-packages, I extend this definition to include having access to the package development tools provided by devtools in the Posit Workbench IDE. See the Packages chapter for more information.5\nR Project: Any directory of R executable files with an RStudio/Posit workbench project file (.Rproj). See the Packages chapter for more information.6\nStandalone app function: A standalone app function encapsulates the UI and server components of a Shiny app into a single function. App function typically end with a call to shinyApp(ui, server, ...) and are used to launch or deploy the the app after installing or loading the app-package.7\nUtility/helper function: A utility or helper function is a non-Shiny function that is used for the business logic (i.e., data processing, manipulation, or other common operations) that supports the main functionalities of the application.

    "text": "F.0.1 Example: mocking add-on functions\nTest code may rely on external systems, behavior, functions, or objects. To ensure that our unit tests remain fast and focused solely on the functional requirement being tested, it’s important to minimize these external dependencies.\nThe mocking functions can be used to substitute functions by emulating their behavior within the test scope (in BDD terms, mocks are creating the Given conditions).1\nWe’ll work through a unit test mocking example from the package development masterclass workshop at posit::conf(2023). Instead of real-time computations, mocks return predefined responses to given inputs. Consider the check_installed() function below:\ncheck_installed &lt;- function(package) {\n  if (is_installed(package)) {\n    return(invisible())\n  } else {\n    stop(\"Please install '{package}' before continuing\")\n  }\n}\nWe’ll use local_mocked_bindings() from testthat to mock the behavior of rlang::is_installed(). Below is a feature description for check_installed() and two scenarios for each expected behavior:\nThe check_installed() shouldn’t be confused with rlang::check_installed(), which checks if a package is installed, and if it isn’t, prompts the user install the package using pak::pkg_install().\nLets review how is_installed() behaves with installed and missing packages:\nrlang::is_installed('foo')\n## [1] FALSE\nrlang::is_installed('base')\n## [1] TRUE\nThe version of check_installed() in sap will check if a package is installed and return invisible() if it is (which, when assigned to an object, evaluates to NULL):\ncheck_installed('base')\nx &lt;- check_installed('base')\nx\n## NULL\nIf the package is not installed, check_installed() prints an error message:\ncheck_installed('foo')\n## Error in check_installed(\"foo\"): Please install '{package}' before continuing\nTo use mocking with is_installed(), we’ll use the following syntax:\nIn this case, {local function} is is_installed() from rlang, and we want to test the two possible {value}s (TRUE/FALSE).\nIn the first test, we’ll use expect_error() to confirm that the error message is returned for an uninstalled package by using local_mocked_bindings() and setting the is_installed() value to FALSE:\ndescribe(\"Feature: Checking if an R package is installed\", {\n  \n  test_that(\n    \"Scenario: Checking an uninstalled package\n        Given the R package 'foo' is not installed\n        When I call the `check_installed()` function with 'foo'\n        Then the function should raise an error with the message\n        `Please install 'nonexistent_package' before continuing`\", {\n          \n1    test_logger(start = \"mock is_installed\", msg = \"FALSE\")\n2    local_mocked_bindings(is_installed = function(package) FALSE)\n3    expect_error(object = check_installed(\"foo\"))\n    test_logger(end = \"mock is_installed\", msg = \"FALSE\")\n    \n  })\n  \n})\n\n\n1\n\nLog test start and end\n\n2\n\nSet {value} to FALSE\n\n\n3\n\nPass a package we know is not installed\nTo test installed packages, we’ll confirm check_installed('foo') with expect_invisible():\ndescribe(\"Feature: Checking if an R package is installed\", {\n  \n  test_that(\n    \"Scenario: Checking an installed package\n        Given the R package 'base' is installed\n        When I call the `check_installed()` function with 'base'\n        Then the function should return without any error\", {\n          \n1    test_logger(start = \"mock is_installed\", msg = \"TRUE\")\n2    local_mocked_bindings(is_installed = function(package) TRUE)\n3    expect_invisible(check_installed(\"base\"))\n    test_logger(end = \"mock is_installed\", msg = \"TRUE\")\n    \n  })\n})\n\n\n1\n\nLog test start and end\n\n2\n\nSet {value} to TRUE\n\n\n3\n\nPass a package we know is installed\nThe output from the tests above is provided below:",
